\chapter {Presentation}

\Sympa is an electronic mailing list manager.  It is used to automate
list management functions such as subscription, moderation,
archive and shared document management. 
It also includes management functions which
would normally require a substantial amount of work (time-consuming
and costly for the list owner). These
functions include automatic management of subscription renewals,
list maintenance, and many others.

\Sympa manages many different kinds of lists. It includes
a web interface for all list functions including management. It allows
a precise definition of each list feature, such as sender authorization,
the moderating process, etc. \Sympa defines, for each feature of each list,
exactly who is authorized to perform the relevant operations, along with the
authentication method to be used. Currently, authentication can be based
on either an smtp From header, a password, or an S/MIME signature.\\
\Sympa is also able to extract electronic
addresses from an LDAP directory or SQL server, and include them
dynamically in a list.

\Sympa manages the dispatching of messages, and makes it possible to
reduce the load on the computer system where it is installed. In
configurations with sufficient memory, \Sympa is especially well
adapted to handling large lists: for a list of 20,000 subscribers, it requires
less than 6 minutes to send a message to 95 percent of the subscribers,
assuming that the network is available (tested on a 300~MHz, 256~MB
i386 serveur with Linux).

This guide covers the installation, configuration and management of
the current release (\version) of
\htmladdnormallink {sympa} {http://listes.cru.fr/sympa/}.

\section {License}

\Sympa is free software; you may distribute it under the terms
of the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {GNU General Public License Version 2}
        {http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html}

You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
this package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

\section {Features}

\Sympa provides all the basic features that any mailing list management robot
should include. While most \Sympa features have their equivalents in other
mailing list applications, \Sympa is unique in including features
in a single software package, including:

\begin {itemize}
    \item High speed distribution processing and load control. \Sympa
        can be tuned to allow the system administrator to control
        the amount of computer resources used.  Its optimized algorithm
        allows:

        \begin {itemize}
            \item the use of your prefered SMTP engine, e.g.
                \unixcmd {sendmail}, \unixcmd {qmail} or \unixcmd
                {postfix}

            \item tuning of the maximum number of SMTP child processes

            \item grouping of messages according to recipients' domains,
	    	and tuning of the grouping factor

            \item detailed logging

        \end {itemize}

    \item \textbf {Multilingual} messages. The current version of
        \Sympa allows the administrator to choose the language
        catalog at run time. At the present time the \Sympa robot is available in
        English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Finnish and Chinese
	(Big5 and GB). The web interface is available in English, Spanish
	and French.

    \item \textbf {MIME support}. \Sympa naturally respects
        \textindex {MIME} in the distribution process, and in addition
        allows list owners to configure their lists with
        welcome, goodbye and other predefined messages using complex
        \textindex {MIME} structures. For example, a welcome message can be
        \textbf in {multipart/alternative} format, using \textbf {text/html},
        \textbf {audio/x-wav}~:-), or whatever (Note that \Sympa
        commands in multipart messages are successfully processed, provided that
	one part is \textbf {text/plain }).

    \item The \textbf {sending process is controlled} on a per-list basis.
        The list definition allows a number of different actions for
        each incoming message. A \lparam {private} list is a list where
        only subscribers can send messages. A list configured using
        \lparam {privateoreditorkey} mode accepts incoming messages
        from subscribers, but will forward any other (i.e. non-subscriber) message
	to the editor with a one-time secret numeric key that will be used by the
        editor to \textit {reject} or \textit {distribute} it.
        For details about the different sending modes, refer to the
        \lparam {send} parameter (\ref {par-send}, page~\pageref
        {par-send}). The sending process configuration (as well as most other list
	operations) is defined using  a \textbf {scenario}. Any listmaster
        can define new scenarios (scenarii) in order to complement the 20
	predefined configurations included in the distribution. \\
        Example : forward multipart messages to the list editor, while
	distributing others without requiring any further authorization.
        
    \item Privileged operations can be performed by list editors or
        list owners (or any other user category), as defined in the list
        \file {config} file or by
        the robot \textindex {administrator}, the listmaster, defined
        in the \file {/etc/sympa.conf} global configuration file.
        Privileged operations include the usual \mailcmd {ADD}, \mailcmd
        {DELETE} or \mailcmd {REVIEW} commands, which can be
        authenticated via a one-time password or an S/MIME signature.
	 Any list owner using the \mailcmd {EXPIRE}
        command can require the renewal of subscriptions. This is made
        possible by the presence of a subscription date stored in the
        \Sympa database.


    \item E-mail addresses can be retrieved dynamically from a database
    	accepting SQL queries, or from an LDAP directory. In the interest
	of reasonable response times, \Sympa retains the data source in an
	internal cache controlled by a TTL (Time To Live) parameter.

    \item Inclusion of the subscribers of one list among the subscribers of
    	another. This is real inclusion, not the dirty, multi-level cascading
	one might otherwise obtain by simply "subscribing list B to list A".
	 
    \item The internal subscriber data structure can be stored in a
        database or, for compatibility with versions 1.x, in text
        files. The introduction of databases came out of the
        \WWSympa project.  The database ensures a secure access to
        shared data. The Perl database API \textit {dbi/dbd} enables
        interoperability with various RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
        Oracle, Sybase).

    \label {wwsympa} 
    \item {\WWSympa} is a global Web interface to all \Sympa functions
    	(including administration). It provides :

        \begin {itemize}

	    \item classification of lists, along with a search index

            \item access control to all functions, including the list of lists
                  (which makes WWsympa particulary well suited to be the main
		  groupware tool within an intranet)
 
       	    \item management of shared documents (download, upload, specific
		  access control for each document)

            \item an HTML document presenting each user with the list of
		  her current subscriptions, including access to archives, and
		  subscription options

            \item management tools for list managers (bounce processing, changing of
                  list parameters, moderating incoming messages)

            \item tools for the robot administrator (list creation, global robot
                  configuration) \index{administrator}

        \end {itemize}



\end {itemize}


\section {Project directions}

Future developments should include:

\begin {itemize}

    \item Virtual robot definition. ISPs would appreciate the
        equivalent of \htmladdnormallinkfoot {Apache} {http://www.apache.org}
        virtual server features applied to mailing lists.

    \item Additional groupware features such as a calendar, a scenario editor, etc

    \item Subscriber preference for multipart/alternative message reception.
          Some newspapers publish both text/plain and text/html version of
          their mails. It would be nice to provide a single list for both formats.

\end {itemize}

\section {History}

\Sympa development started from scratch in 1995. The goal was to
ensure continuity with the \textindex {TULP} list manager, produced
partly by the initial author of \Sympa: Christophe Wolfhugel.

New features were required, which the TULP code was just not up to
handling. The initial version of \Sympa brought authentication,
the flexible management of commands, high performances in internal
data access, and object oriented code for easy code maintenance.

It took nearly two years to produce the first market releases.

\section {Authors and credits}

Christophe Wolfhugel is the author of the first beta version of
\Sympa. He developed it while working for the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {Institut Pasteur} {http://www.pasteur.fr}.

Later developments have mainly been driven by the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {Comit\'e R\'eseaux des Universit\'es} {http://www.cru.fr}
(Olivier Sala\"un and Serge Aumont), who look after a large mailing
list service.

Our thanks to all contributors, including:

\begin {itemize}

   \item Pierre David, who in addition to his help and suggestions
       in developing the code, participated more than actively in
       producing this manual.

  \item Ollivier Robert, Usenet Canal Historique and the good manners
      guru in the Perl program.

  \item Rapha\"el Hertzog (debian) and St\'ephane Poirey (redhat) for
      Linux packages.

  \item Olivier Lacroix, for all his perseverance in bug fixing.

  \item Fabien Marquois, who introduced many new features such as
      the digest.

  \item Alex Nappa and Josep Roman for their Spanish translations

  \item Carsten Clasohm and Jens-Uwe Gaspar for their German translations

  \item Marco Ferrante for his Italian translations

  \item Hubert Ulliac for search in archive base on marcsearch.pm

  \item Tung Siu Fai for his Chinese translations

  \item and also: Manuel Valente, Dominique ROUSSEAU,
    Laurent Ghys, Francois Petillon, Guy Brand, Jean Brange, Fabrice
    Gaillard, Hervé Maza

   \item Anonymous critics who never missed a chance to
       remind us that \textit {smartlist} already did all that
       better.

   \item All contributors and beta-testers cited in the \file
       {RELEASE\_NOTES} file, who, by serving as guinea pigs and
       being the first to use it, made it possible to quickly and
       efficiently debug the \Sympa software.

    \item Bernard Barbier, without whom \Sympa would not
        have a name.

\end {itemize}

We ask all those we have forgotten to thank to accept our apologies
and to let us know, so that we can correct this error in future
releases of this documentation.

\section {Organization}
\label {organization}

Here is a snapshot of what \Sympa looks like once it has settled down
on your system. This also illustrates the \Sympa philosophy, I guess.

\begin {itemize}

	\item \tildedir {sympa/}\\
	The root directory of \Sympa. You will find almost everything
	related to \Sympa under this directory, except logs and main
	configuration files.
	
	\item \tildedir {sympa/bin/}\\
	This directory contains the binaries, including CGI. It
	also contains the default scenarios, templates and configuration
	files.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/}\\
	Here \Sympa stores the default versions of what it will otherwise find
	in \tildedir {sympa/etc/} (scenarios, templates and configuration
	files, recognized S/Mime certificates).

	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/}\\
	This is your site's configuration directory. Consult
	\tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/} when drawing up your own.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/create\_list\_templates/}\\
	List templates (suggested at list creation time).

	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/scenari/}\\
	This directory will contain your scenarios. If you don't
	know what the hell a scenario is, refer to \ref {scenarii}, 
	page~\pageref {scenarii}.
	
	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/wws\_templates/}\\
	The web interface (\WWSympa) is composed of template HTML
	files parsed by the CGI program.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/templates/}\\
	Some of the mail robot's replies are defined by templates
	(\file{welcome.tpl} for SUBSCRIBE). You can overload
	these template files in the individual list directories, but these
	are the defaults.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/}\\
	\Sympa's working directory.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist}\\
	The list directory (refer to \ref {list-directory}, 
	page~\pageref {list-directory}).

	\item \tildedir {sympa/nls/}\\
	Internationalization directory. It contains XPG4-compatible
	message catalogues. \Sympa has currently been translated
	into 8 different languages.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/}\\
	\Sympa uses 7 different spools (see \ref{spools}, page~\pageref{spools}).

	\item \tildedir {sympa/src/}\\
	\Sympa sources.

\end {itemize}

\section {Binaries}
\label {binaries}

\begin {itemize}

	\item \file {sympa.pl}\\
	The main daemon ; it processes commands and delivers
	messages. Continuously scans the \dir {msg/} spool.

	\item \file {wwsympa.fcgi}\\
	The CGI program offering a complete web interface
	to mailing lists. It can work in both classical CGI and
	FastCGI modes, although we recommand FastCGI mode, being
	up to 10 times faster.

	\item \file {bounced.pl}\\
	This daemon processes bounces (non-delivered messages),
	looking for the bad addresses. List owners will later
	access bounce information via \WWSympa. Continuously scans
	the \dir {bounce/} spool.

	\item \file {archived.pl}\\
	This daemon feeds the web archives, converting messages
	to HTML format and linking them. It uses the amazing 
	\file {MhOnArc}. Continuously scans the \dir {outgoing/} 
	spool.

	\item \file {queue}\\
	This small program gets the incoming messages from the aliases
	and stores them in \dir {msg/} spool.

	\item \file {bouncequeue}\\
	Same as \file {queue} for bounces. Stores bounces in 
	\dir {bounce/} spool.

\end {itemize}

\section {Configuration files}

\begin {itemize}

	\item \file {sympa.conf}\\
	The main configuration file.
	See \ref{exp-admin}, page~\pageref{exp-admin}.
	

	\item \file {wwsympa.conf}\\
	\WWSympa configuration file.
	See \ref{wwsympa}, page~\pageref{wwsympa}.
	
	\item \file {edit\_list.conf}\\
	Defines which parameters/files are editable by
	owners. See \ref{list-edition}, page~\pageref{list-edition}.

	\item \file {topics.conf}\\
	Contains the declarations your site's topics (classification in
	\WWSympa), along with their titles. A sample is provided in the
	\dir {sample/} directory of the sympa distribution.
	See \ref{topics}, page~\pageref{topics}.

\end {itemize}

\section {Spools}
\label {spools}

See \ref{spool-related}, page~\pageref{spool-related} for spool definition
in \file {sympa.conf}.

\begin {itemize}

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/auth/}\\
	For storing messsages until they have been confirmed.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/bounce/}\\
	For storing incoming bouncing messages.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/digest/}\\
	For storing lists' digests before they are sent.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/expire/}\\
	Used by the expire process.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/mod/}\\
	For storing unmoderated messages.

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/msg/}\\
	For storing incoming messages (including commands).

	\item \tildedir {sympa/spool/outgoing/}\\
	\file {sympa.pl} dumps messages in this spool to await archiving
	by \file {archived.pl}.

\end {itemize}

% Installing Sympa
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\cleardoublepage
\chapter {Installing \Sympa}

%\begin {htmlonly}
%<A NAME="installsympa">
%\end {htmlonly}

\Sympa is a program written in Perl. It also calls a short
program written in C for tasks which it would be unreasonable to
perform via an interpreted language.

\section {Obtaining \Sympa, related links}

The \Sympa distribution is available from
\htmladdnormallink {\texttt {http://listes.cru.fr/sympa/}}
    {http://listes.cru.fr/sympa/}.
All important resources are referenced there:

\begin {itemize}
    \item sources
    \item \file {RELEASE\_NOTES}
    \item .rpm and .deb packages for Linux
    \item user mailing list
        (see~\ref {sympa@cru.fr}, page~\pageref {sympa@cru.fr})
    \item contributions
    \item ...
\end {itemize}


\section {Prerequisites}

\Sympa installation and configuration are relatively easy
tasks for experienced Unix users who have already installed Perl packages.

Note that most of the installation time will
involve putting in place the prerequisites, if they are not
already on the system. No more than a handful of ancillary tools are needed,
and on recent UNIX systems their installation is normally very
straightforward. We strongly advise you to perform installation steps and
checks in the order listed below; these steps will be explained in
detail in later sections.

\begin {itemize}
    \item identification of host system characteristics

    \item installation of DB Berkeley module (already installed on
      most UNIX systems)

    \item installation of
        \htmladdnormallinkfoot {CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)}
                {http://www.perl.com/CPAN}
        modules

    \item creation of a Unix user

\end {itemize}

\subsection {System requirements}

You should have a Unix system that is more or less recent in order
to be able to use \Sympa. In particular, it is necessary
that your system have an ANSI C compiler (in other words, your compiler
should support prototypes), as well as XPG4-standard \textindex {NLS}
(Native Language Support, for languages other than English) extensions.

\Sympa has been installed and tested on the following
systems, therefore you should not have any special problems:

\begin {itemize}
    \item Linux (various distributions)
    \item FreeBSD 2.2.x and 3.x
    \item Digital Unix 4.x
    \item Solaris 2.5 and 2.6
    \item AIX 4.x
    \item HP-UX 10.20
\end {itemize}

Anyone willing to port it to NT ? ;-)

If your Unix system has a \unixcmd {gencat} command as well as
\unixcmd {catgets(3)} and \unixcmd {catopen(3)} functions, it is
likely that it has \textindex {NLS} extensions and that these extensions comply
with the XPG4 specifications.

Finally, most Unix systems are now supplied with an ANSI C compiler;
if this is not the case, you can install the \unixcmd {gcc} compiler,
which you will find on the nearest GNU site, for example
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {in France} {ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/mirrors/gnu/}.

To complete the installation, you should make sure that you have a
sufficiently recent release of the \unixcmd {sendmail} MTA, i.e. release
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {8.9.x} {ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/mirrors/sendmail-ucb/}
or a more recent release. You may also use \unixcmd {postfix} or
\unixcmd {qmail}.

\subsection {Install Berkeley DB (NEWDB)}

Unix systems often include a particularly unsophisticated mechanism to
manage indexed files.  This consists of extensions known as \texttt {dbm}
and \texttt {ndbm}, which are unable to meet the needs of many more recent
programs, including \Sympa, which uses the \textindex {DB package}
initially developed at the University of California in Berkeley,
and which is now maintained by the company \htmladdnormallinkfoot
{Sleepycat software} {http://www.sleepycat.com}.  Many UNIX  systems
like Linux, FreeBSD or Digital Unix 4.x have the DB package in the
standard version. If not you should install this tool if you have not 
already done so.

You can retrieve DB on the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {Sleepycat site} {http://www.sleepycat.com/},
where you will also find clear installation instructions.

\subsection {Install Perl and CPAN modules}

To be able to use \Sympa you must have release 5.004\_03 or later of the
Perl language, as well as several CPAN modules.

At \texttt {make} time, the \unixcmd {check\_perl\_modules.pl} script is run to
check for installed versions of required Perl and CPAN modules. If a CPAN module is
missing or out of date, this script will install it for you. 

You can also download and install CPAN modules yourself. You will find 
a current release of the Perl interpreter in the nearest CPAN archive. 
If you do not know where to find a nearby site, use the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {CPAN multiplexer} {http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz};
it will find one for you.

\subsection {Required CPAN modules}

The following CPAN modules required by \Sympa are not included in the standard
Perl distribution. We try to keep this list up to date ; if you have any doubts
run the \unixcmd {check\_perl\_modules.pl} script.

\begin {itemize}
   \item DB\_File (v. 1.50 or later)
   \item Msgcat
   \item MD5
   \item MailTools (version 1.13 o later)
   \item MIME-tools (may require IO/Stringy)
   \item MIME-Base64
\end {itemize}

Since release 2, \Sympa requires a DMBS to work properly. It stores 
users' subscriptions and preferences in a database. \Sympa is also
able to extract user data from within an external database. 
These features require that you install database-related Perl libraries.
This includes the generic Database interface (DBI) and a Database Driver
for your RDBMS (DBD) :

\begin {itemize}
   \item \textbf {DBI} (DataBase Interface)

   \item \textbf {DBD} (DataBase Driver) related to your RDBMS (e.g.
       Msql-Mysql-modules for MySQL)

\end {itemize}

If you plan to interface \Sympa with an LDAP directory to build
dynamical mailing lists, you need to install Perl LDAP libraries :

\begin {itemize}
    \item \textbf {Net::LDAP} (perlldap).

\end {itemize}

\subsection {Create a Unix user}

The final step prior to installing \Sympa: create a Unix user (and
if possible a group) specific to the program. Most of the installation
will be carried out with this account. We suggest that you use the
name \texttt {sympa} for both user and group. Note that UID.GID must be
the same as your httpd. If you are running a dedicated httpd server,
this can be sympa.sympa, otherwise it is possible either to define a virtual httpd
server setting UID.GID, or to run \Sympa as nobody.nobody. 
This second solution is not advisable because the information managed by \Sympa
will be owned by nobody.

Numerous files will be located in the \Sympa user's login directory.
Throughout the remainder of this documentation we shall refer to this
login directory as \tildedir {sympa/}.

\section {Compilation and installation }

Before using \Sympa, you must customize the sources in order to
specify a small number of parameters specific to your installation.

First, extract the sources from the archive file, for example
from the \tildedir {sympa/} directory: the archive will create a
directory named \dir {sympa-\version/} where all the useful files
and directories will be located. In particular, you will have a
\dir {doc/} directory containing this documentation in various
formats; a \dir {sample/} directory containing a few examples of
configuration files; an \dir {nls/} directory where multi-lingual
messages are stored; and, of course, the \dir {src/} directory for the
mail robot and \dir {wwsympa} for the web interface.

Example:

\begin {quote}
\tt
\# su - \\
\$ gzip -dc sympa-\version.tar.gz | tar xf -
\end {quote}

\label {makefile}

Before running \unixcmd {make} in the main
directory, you should edit and configure \file {Makefile},
the first part of which requires customization.
We advise against changing anything located after the STOP
line.

The \file {Makefile} file contains explanations for the fields,
which you may have to change. They main ones are :
\begin {itemize}
\item USER and GROUP, the id of daemons.
\item CONFIG and WWSCONFIG, the location of robot and cgi configurations
\item DIR, the \Sympa home dir
\item MAILERPROGDIR, the location of queue and bouncequeue programs. If sendmail
is configured to use smrsh (check the mailer prog definition in your sendmail.cf),
queue and bouncequeue need to be installed in /etc/smrsh.  This is probably
the case if you are using redhat 6.X.
\item SENDMAIL\_ALIASES, the sendmail aliases file. This is used by the alias\_manager
script.
\item NEWALIASES, the path to newaliases command.
\item INITDIR, the directory to contain a SYSV init script (typically /etc.rc.d/init.d/)
\item DESTDIR, can be set in the main Makefile to install sympa in DESTDIR/DIR
(instead of DIR). This is usefull for building RPM and DEB packages.
\item PERL, SH and CC and GENCAT, respectivly perl, sh, cc and gencat locations. 
\item DARK\_COLOR, LIGHT\_COLOR, TEXT\_COLOR, BG\_COLOR, ERROR\_COLOR to define wwsympa
RGB colors
\end {itemize}

Once this file has been configured, you need to run the \texttt {make;make~install} commands.
This generates the binary for the \file {queue} program along with the nls, and inserts
the \Sympa and \WWSympa programs in their final slot, while having propagated
a few parameters into the Perl files, such the access path
to the Perl program. The make command includes the checking of cpan modules.
 
If everything goes smoothly, the \tildedir {sympa/bin/} directory
will contain various Perl programs as well as the \file {queue}
binary.  You will remark that this binary has the \index{set-uid-on-exec
bit} \textit {set-uid-on-exec} bit (owner is the \texttt {sympa}
user): this is deliberate, and indispensable if \Sympa is to run correctly.

\subsection {Choosing directory locations}

All directories are defined in the \file {/etc/sympa.conf} file, which
is read by \Sympa at runtime. If no \file {sympa.conf} file
was found during installation, a sample one will be created.
For the default organization of directories, please refer to \ref {organization}, 
page~\pageref {organization}.

It would, of course, be possible to disperse files and directories to a number of different
locations. However, we recommend storing all the directories and files in  the \texttt {sympa}
user's login directory.

These directories must be created manually now. You can use restrictive
authorizations if you like, since only programs running with the
\texttt {sympa} account will need to access them.


\section {Robot aliases}
    \index{aliases}
    \index{mail aliases}

An electronic list manager such as \Sympa is built around two processing steps:

\begin {itemize}
    \item a message sent to a list or to \Sympa itself
        (for subscribe, unsubscribe, help messages, etc.) is received
        by the SMTP server (\unixcmd {sendmail} or \unixcmd {qmail}).
        The SMTP server, on reception of this message, runs the
        \file {queue} program (supplied in this package) to store
        the message in a queue, i.e. in a special directory.

    \item the \file {sympa.pl} daemon, set in motion at
        system startup, scans the queue. As soon as it
        detects a new message, it processes it and performs the
        requested action (distribution or processing of an
        administrative request).

\end {itemize}

To separate the processing of administrative requests (subscription,
unsubscription, help requests, etc.) from the processing of messages destined for mailing
lists, a special mail alias is reserved for administrative requests, so
that \Sympa can be permanently accessible to users. The following
lines must therefore be added to the \unixcmd {sendmail} alias file
(often \file {/etc/aliases}):

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
sympa:             "| /home/sympa/bin/queue sympa"
listmaster: 	   "| /home/sympa/bin/queue listmaster"
bounce+*:          "| /home/sympa/bin/bouncequeue sympa"
sympa-request:     postmaster
sympa-owner:       postmaster
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\mailaddr {sympa-request} should be the address of the robot
\textindex {administrator}, i.e. a person who looks after
\Sympa (here \mailaddr {postmaster{\at}cru.fr}).

\mailaddr {sympa-owner} is the return address for \Sympa error
messages.

The alias bounce+* is dedicated to collect bounces. It is useful
only if at least one list uses \texttt { welcome\_return\_path unique } or
\texttt { remind\_return\_path unique}.
Don't forget to run \unixcmd {newaliases} after any change to
the \file {/etc/aliases} file!

Note: aliases based on \mailaddr {listserv} (in addition to those
based on \mailaddr {sympa}) can be added for the benefit of users
accustomed to the \mailaddr {listserv} and \mailaddr {majordomo} names.
For example:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
listserv:          sympa
listserv-request:  sympa-request
majordomo:         sympa
listserv-owner:    sympa-owner
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

Note: it will also be necessary to add entries in this alias file
when lists are created (see list creation section, \ref {list-aliases},
page~\pageref {list-aliases}).


\section {Logs}

\Sympa keeps a trace of each of its procedures in its log file.
However, this requires configuration of the \unixcmd {syslogd}
daemon.  By default \Sympa wil use the \texttt {local1} facility
(\lparam {syslog} parameter in \file {sympa.conf}).
WWSympa's logging behaviour is defined by the \lparam {log\_facility}
parameter in \file {wwsympa.conf} (by default the same facility as \Sympa).\\
To this end, a line must be added in the \unixcmd {syslogd} configuration file (\file
{/etc/syslog.conf}). For example:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
local1.*       /var/log/sympa 
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

Then reload \unixcmd {syslogd}.

Depending on your platform, your syslog daemon may use either
a UDP or a Unix socket. \Sympa's default is to use a Unix socket;
you may change this behaviour by editing \file {sympa.conf}'s
\lparam {log\_socket\_type} parameter (\ref{par-log-socket-type},
page~\pageref{par-log-socket-type}).

\section {Daemon loading}

Once the files are configured, all that remains is to start \Sympa.
At startup, \file {sympa.pl} will change its UID to sympa (as defined in \file {Makefile}).
To do this, add the following sequence or its equivalent in your
\file {/etc/rc.local}:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}

~sympa/bin/sympa.pl
~sympa/bin/archived.pl
~sympa/bin/bounced.pl

\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\file {sympa.pl} recognizes the following command line arguments:

\begin {itemize}

\item --debug | -d 
  
  Sets \Sympa in debug mode and keeps it attached to the terminal. 
  Debugging information is output to STDERR, along with standard log
  information. Each function call is traced. Usefull while reporting
  a bug.
  
\item --config | -f \textit {config\_file}
  
  Forces \Sympa to use an alternative configuration file. Default behaviour is
  to use the configuration file as defined in the Makefile (\$CONFIG).
  
\item --mail | -m 
  
  \Sympa will log calls to sendmail, including recipients. Useful for
  keeping track of each mail sent (log files may grow faster though).
  
\item --lang | -l \textit {catalog}
  
  Set this option to use a language catalog for \Sympa. 
  The corresponding catalog file must be located in \tildedir {sympa/nls}
  directory. 
  
  For example, with the \file {fr.cat} catalog:

\item --keepcopy | -k \textit {receipient\_directory}

  This option tells Sympa to keep a copy of every incoming message,
  instead of deleting them. \textit {receipient\_directory} is the directory
  to store messages.

  
  \begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
/home/sympa/bin/sympa.pl
\end{verbatim}
  \end {quote}

\item --dump \textit {listname | ALL}
  
  Dumps subscribers of a list or all lists. Subscribers are dumped
  in \file {subscribers.db.dump}.
 
\item --import \textit {listname}
  
Import subscribers in the \textit {listname} list. Data are read from STDIN.
  
\item --lowercase 
  
Lowercases email addresses in database.

\item --help | -h
  
  Print usage of sympa.pl.
   

\item --version | -v
  
  Print current version of \Sympa.
 
  
\end {itemize}

\chapter {sympa.conf parameters}
    \label {exp-admin}
    \index{sympa.conf}
    \index{configuration file}

The \file {/etc/sympa.conf} configuration file contains numerous
parameters which are read on start-up of \Sympa. If you change this file, do not forget
that you will need to restart \Sympa afterwards. 

The \file {/etc/sympa.conf} file contains directives in the following
format:

\begin {quote}
    \textit {keyword    value}
\end{quote}

Comments start with the \texttt {\#} character at the beginning of
a line.  Empty lines are also considered as comments and are ignored.
There should only be one directive per line, but their order in
the file is of no importance.

\section {Site customization}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {host}}

        This keyword is \textbf {mandatory}. It is the domain name
	used in the \rfcheader {From} header in replies to administrative requests.

        \example {host listhost.cru.fr}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {email}} 
	
	\default {sympa}

        Username (the part of the address preceding the \texttt {@} sign) used
        in the \rfcheader {From} header in replies to administrative requests.

        \example {email           listserv}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {listmaster}} 

        The list of email addresses  of listmasters (users authorized to perform
        global  serveur commands).

        \example {listmaster postmaster@cru.fr,root@home.cru.fr}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {wwsympa\_url}}  

	 \default {http://<host>/wws}

	This is the root URL of \WWSympa.

        \example {wwsympa\_url https://my.server/wws}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {cookie}} 

	This string is used to generate MD5 authentication keys.
	It allows generated authentication keys to differ from one
	site to another. It is also used for reversible encryption of
        user passwords stored in the database. The presence of this string
	is one reason why access to \file {sympa.conf} needs to be restricted
	to the Sympa user. 
       
        Note that changing this parameter will break all
        http cookies stored in users' browsers, as well as all user passwords.

        \example {cookie gh869jku5}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {create\_list}}  

	 \default {listmaster}

	Defines who can create lists (or request list creations).
	Sympa will use the corresponding scenario.

        \example {create\_list intranet}

\section {Directories}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {home}}

	 \default {\tildedir {sympa/expl}}

        The directory whose subdirectories correspond to the different lists.

        \example {home          /home/sympa/expl}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {etc}}

	 \default {\tildedir {sympa/etc}}

        This is the local directory for configuration files (such as
	\file {edit\_list.conf}. It contains 3 subdirectories:
	\dir {scenari} for local scenari; \dir {templates}
	for the site's local templates and default list templates; and \dir {wws\_templates}
        for the site's local html templates.

        \example {home          /home/sympa/etc}

\section {System related}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {syslog}} 

	\default {LOCAL1}

        Name of the sub-system (facility) for logging messages.

        \example {syslog          LOCAL2}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {log\_socket\_type}} 
    \label {par-log-socket-type}

	\default {inet}

        \Sympa communicates with \unixcmd {syslogd}
        using either UDP or Unix sockets.  Set \cfkeyword
        {log\_socket\_type} to \texttt {inet} to use UDP, or \texttt
        {unix} for Unix sockets.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {pidfile}} 

	\default {\tildefile {sympa/sympa.pid}}

        The file where the \file {sympa.pl} daemon stores its
        process number. Warning: the \texttt {sympa} user must be
        able to write to this file, and to create it if it doesn't
        exist.

        \example {pidfile         /var/run/sympa.pid}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {umask}} 

	\default {027}

        Default mask for file creation (see \unixcmd {umask}(2)).

        \example {umask 007}

\section {Sending related}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {maxsmtp}} 

	\default {20}

        Maximum number of SMTP delivery child processes spawned
        by  \Sympa. This is the main load control parameter.

        \example {maxsmtp           500}


\subsection {\cfkeyword {max\_size}} 

	\default {5 Mb}

	Maximum size allowed for messages distributed by \Sympa.
	This may be customized per list by setting the \lparam {max\_size} 
	list parameter.

        \example {max\_size           2097152}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {nrcpt}} 

	\default {25}

        Maximum number of recipients per \unixcmd {sendmail} call.
        This grouping factor makes it possible for the (\unixcmd
        {sendmail}) MTA to optimize the number of SMTP sessions for
        message distribution.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {avg}} 

	\default {10}

        Maximum number of different internet domains within addresses per
        \unixcmd {sendmail} call.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {sendmail}} 

	\default {/usr/sbin/sendmail}

        Absolute call path to SMTP message transfer agent (\unixcmd
        {sendmail} for example).

        \example {sendmail        /usr/sbin/sendmail}


\subsection {\cfkeyword {rfc2369\_header\_fields}} 

	\default {help,subscribe,unsubscribe,post,owner,archive}

	RFC2369 compliant header fields (List-xxx) to be added to 
	distributed messages. These header-fields should be implemented
	by MUAs, adding menus.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {remove\_headers}} 

        \default {Return-Receipt-To,Precedence,X-Sequence,Disposition-Notification-To}

        This is the list of headers that \Sympa should remove from
        outgoing messages. Use it, for example, to ensure some privacy
        for your users by discarding anonymous options.
        It is (for the moment) site-wide. It is applied before the
        \Sympa, {rfc2369\_header\_fields}, and {custom\_header} fields are
        added.

\example {remove\_headers      Resent-Date,Resent-From,Resent-To,Resent-Message-Id,Sender,Delivered-To,Return-Receipt-To,Precedence,X-Sequence,Disposition-Notification-To}


\section {Spool related}

	\default {\tildedir  {digest}}

        This parameter is optional and retained solely for backward compatibility.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {queueexpire}}  

	\default {\tildedir {sympa/spool/expire}}

        This parameter is optional and retained solely for backward compatibility.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {queueauth}}

	\default {1}

        Retention period (in days) for ``bad'' messages in
        \textindex {spool} (as specified by \cfkeyword {queue}).
        \Sympa keeps messages rejected for various reasons (badly
        formatted, looping, etc.) in
        this directory, with a name prefixed by \texttt {BAD}.
        This configuration variable controls the number of days
        these messages are kept.

        \example {clean\_delay\_queue 3}

\subsection {\cfkeyword {clean\_delay\_queuemod}} 

	\default {10}

        Expiration delay (in days) in the \textindex {moderation}

	(bounces) and should have a low priority.

        Available since release 2.3.3


\subsection {\cfkeyword {default\_list\_priority}}  
        \label {kw-default-list-priority}

	\default {5}

        Default priority for messages if not defined in the list
        configuration file.

        Available since release 2.3.1.

\section {Database related}

The following parameters are needed when using an RDBMS, but otherwise are not
required:

\subsection {\cfkeyword {db\_type}}

        Database management system used (e.g. mysql, Pg, Oracle)
	
	This corresponds to the DataBase Driver (DBD) name and
	is therefore case-sensitive.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {db\_name}} 

	\default {sympa}

        Name of the database containing user information. See
        detailed notes on database structure, \ref{rdbms-struct},
        page~\pageref{rdbms-struct}.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {db\_host}}

        Database host name.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {db\_user}}

        User with read access to the database.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {db\_passwd}}

        Password for \cfkeyword {db\_user}.

\section {Loop prevention}

   The following define your loop prevention policy for commands.
(see~\ref {loop-detection}, page~\pageref {loop-detection})

\subsection {\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_max}}

	\default {200}

	The maximum number of command reports sent to an email
	address. When it is reached, messages are stored with the BAD
	prefix, and reports are no longer sent.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_sampling\_delay}} 

	\default {3600}

	This parameter defines the delay in seconds before decrementing
	the counter of reports sent to an email address.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_decrease\_factor}} 

	\default {0.5}

	The decrementation factor (\texttt {from 0 to 1}), used to
	determine the new report counter after expiration of the delay.

\section {S/MIME configuration}

\Sympa can optionally verify and use S/MIME signatures for security purposes.
In this case, three optional parameters must be assigned by the listmaster
(see \ref {smimeconf},  page~\pageref {smimeconf}).

\subsection {\cfkeyword {openssl}}

The path for the openssl binary file.
         
\subsection {\cfkeyword {trusted\_ca\_options}} 
The option used by openssl
        for trusted CA certificates. Required if cfkeyword {openssl} is defined.
	
\subsection {\cfkeyword {key\_passwd}} 

The password for list private key encryption. If not
	defined, \Sympa assumes that list private keys are not encrypted.


\section {Antivirus plug-in}
\label {Antivirus plug-in}

\Sympa can optionally check incoming messages before delivering them, using an external antivirus solution.
You must then set two parameters.

\subsection {\cfkeyword {antivirus\_path}}

The path to your favorite antivirus binary file (including the binary file).

Example :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
antivirus_path		/usr/local/bin/uvscan
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}
   
\subsection {\cfkeyword {antivirus\_args}} 

The arguments used by the antivirus software to look for viruses.
You must set them so as to get the virus name.
You should use, if available, the 'unzip' option and check all extensions.

Example with uvscan :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
antivirus_args		--summary --secure
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

Example with fsav :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
antivirus_args		--dumb	--archive
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\chapter {WWSympa}


WWSympa is \Sympa's web interface.

\section {Organization}
\label {wwsympa}

\WWSympa is fully integrated with \Sympa. It uses \file {sympa.conf}
and \Sympa's libraries. The default \Sympa installation will also
install WWSympa.

Every single piece of HTML in \WWSympa is generated by the CGI code
using template files (See \ref {tpl-format}, page~\pageref {tpl-format}).
This facilitates internationalization of pages, as well as per-site
customization. 

The code consists of one single Perl CGI script, \file {wwsympa.fcgi}.
To enhance performence you can configure \WWSympa to use
FastCGI ; the CGI will be persistent in memory.\\
All data will be accessed through the CGI, including web archives.
This is required to allow the authentication scheme to be applied
systematically.

Authentication is based on passwords stored in the database table
user\_table ; if the the appropriate \file {Crypt::CipherSaber} is
installed, password are encrypted in the database using reversible
encryption based on RC4. Otherwise they are stored in clear text.
In both cases reminding of passwords is possible.
 To keep track of authentication information \WWSympa
uses HTTP cookies stored on the client side. The HTTP cookie only 
indicates that a specified email address has been authentified ;
permissions are evaluated when an action is requested.

The same web interface is used by the listmaster, list owners, subscribers and
others. Depending on permissions, the same URL may generate a different view.

\WWSympa's main loop algorithm is roughly the following : 
\begin {enumerate}
	\item Check authentication information returned by 
	the HTTP cookie

	\item Evaluate user's permissions for the
        requested action 

	\item Process the requested action 

	\item Set up variables resulting from the action 

	\item Parse the HTML template files
\end {enumerate}

\section {Installation}

%\begin {htmlonly}
%<A NAME='installwwsympa'>
%\end {htmlonly}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Edit \Sympa's main Makefile to customize destination dir, conf location,...

\item Install \Sympa

\item cutomize your \file {/etc/wwsympa.conf}

\item set \file {sympa.conf} parameter \cfkeyword {wwsympa\_url}
	to the base URL of your \WWSympa

\end{enumerate} 

\section {wwsympa.conf parameters}

	\subsection {alias\_manager}
	\label {alias-manager}	

	If this parameter is undefined, then you will have to manage your
	aliases manually.
	Provide the path to a script that will install aliases for a new list
	and delete aliases for closed lists. You can use the \tildefile {sympa/bin/alias\_manager.pl}
	script distributed with \Sympa. The script will receive the following arguments :
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item add | del
		\item <list name>
		\item <list domain>
	\end{enumerate}
	Example : \tildefile {sympa/bin/alias\_manager.pl} add \samplelist cru.fr

	\tildefile {sympa/bin/alias\_manager.pl} works on the alias file defined
	by SENDMAIL\_ALIASES variable in the main Makefile (see \ref {makefile},  
	page~\pageref {makefile}). It runs a \unixcmd{newaliases} command (via
	\file {aliaswrapper}), after any changes to aliases file.

	\subsection {arc\_path}

	\default {/home/httpd/html/arc} \\
	Where to store html archives. This parameter is used
        by the \file {archived.pl} daemon. It is a good idea to install the archive
        outside the web hierarchy to prevent possible back doors in the access control
        powered by WWSympa. However, if Apache is configured with a chroot, you may
	have to install the archive in the Apache directory tree.

	\subsection {archive\_default\_index thrd | mail}

	\default {thrd} \\
	The default index organization when entering web archives : either threaded or	
	chronological order.

	\subsection {archived\_pidfile}
	\default {archived.pid} \\
	The file containing the PID of \file {archived.pl}.

	\subsection {bounce\_path}
	\default {/var/bounce} \\
	Root directory for storing bounces (non-delivery reports). This parameter
	is used principally by the \file {bounced.pl} daemon.

	\subsection {bounced\_pidfile}
	\default {bounced.pid} \\
	The file containing the PID of \file {bounced.pl}.

	\subsection {cookie\_expire}
	\default {0}
	Lifetime (in minutes) of HTTP cookies. This is the default value
	when not set explicitly by users.
	
	\subsection {cookie\_domain}
	\default {localhost} \\
	Domain for the HTTP cookies. If beginning with a dot ('.'),
	the cookie is available within the specified internet domain.
	Otherwise, for the specified host. Example : 
		\begin {quote}
		\begin{verbatim}
		   cookie_domain cru.fr
		   cookie is available for host 'cru.fr'

		   cookie_domain .cru.fr
		   cookie is available for any host within 'cru.fr' domain
		\end{verbatim}
		\end {quote}
	The only reason for replacing the default value would be where
	\WWSympa's authentication process is shared with an application
	running on another host.
	
	\subsection {default\_home}
	\default {home} \\
        Organization of the WWSympa home page. If you have only a few lists,
	the default value `home' (presenting a list of lists organized by topic)
	should be replaced by `lists' (a simple alphabetical list of lists).

	\subsection {icons\_url}
	\default {/icons} \\
	URL of WWSympa's icons directory.

      	\subsection {log\_facility}

	WWSympa will log using this facility. Defaults to \Sympa's syslog
        facility.
	Configure your syslog according to this parameter.

	\subsection {mhonarc}
	\default {/usr/bin/mhonarc} \\
	Path to the (superb) MHonArc program. Required for html archives
	http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html

	\subsection {title}
	\default {Mailing List Service} \\
	The name of your mailing list service. It will appear in
	the Title section of WWSympa.

	\subsection {use\_fast\_cgi   0 | 1}
	\default {1} \\
	Choice of whether or not to use FastCGI. On listes.cru.fr, using FastCGI 
        increases WWSympa performance by as much as a factor of 10. Refer to 
       	\htmladdnormallink {http://www.fastcgi.com/} {http://www.fastcgi.com/}
	and the apache config section of this document for details about 
	FastCGI.


\section {MhOnArc}
 
MHonArc is a neat little converter from mime messages to html. Refer to
\htmladdnormallink {http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html}
{http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html}.

The long mhonarc resource file is used by \WWSympa in a particular way,
as mhonarc is used to produce not a complete html document, but only part
(to be included in a complete document starting with <HTML> and terminating
with </HTML> ;-) )
The best way to start is to use the MhOnArc resource file as
provided in the \WWSympa distribution. 

The mhonarc resource file is named \file {mhonarc-ressources}. 
You may locate this file either in \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/mhonarc-ressources}
	in order to create a specific archive look for a particular list

	\item or \tildedir {sympa/bin/mhonarc-ressources}

\end{enumerate}

\section {Archiving daemon}

\file {archived.pl} converts messages from \Sympa's spools 
and calls \file {mhonarc} to create html versions (whose location is defined by the 
"arc\_path" wwsympa parameter). You should probably install these archives 
outside the \Sympa home\_dir (\Sympa's initial choice for storing mail archives : 
\tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist}). Note that the html archive 
contains a text version of each message and is totally separate from \Sympa's
main archive.

\begin{enumerate}

\item create a directory according to the wwsympa "arc\_path" parameter
    (must be owned by sympa, does not have to be in apache space unless
    your server uses chroot)

\item foreach list, if you need a web archive, create a new webarchive paragraph
    in list the config. Example :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
     web_archive
     access public|private|owner|listmaster|closed
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

     If web\_archive is defined for a list, every message distributed by this list is copied
     to \tildedir {sympa/spool/outgoing/}. (No need to create nonexistent subscribers to receive
     copies of messages)

\item start \file {archived.pl}. It MUST run with the same uid/gid as 
\Sympa and Apache
 
\item check \WWSympa logs, or alternatively, start \file {archived.pl} in debug mode (-d). 

\item If you change mhonarc resources and wish to rebuild the entire archive 
using the new look defined for mhonarc, simply create an empty file named
".rebuild.\samplelist@myhost" in \tildedir {sympa/spool/outgoing}, and make sure that
the owner of this file is \Sympa. 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
     example : su sympa -c "touch ~sympa/spool/outgoing/.rebuild.sympa-fr@cru.fr"
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}
You can also rebuild web archives from within the admin page of the list.

\end{enumerate}
 
\section {HTTPD setup}

\subsection {wwsympa.fcgi access permissions}
 
      
     Because Sympa and WWsympa share a lot of files, \file {wwsympa.fcgi},
     must run with the same 
     uid/gid as \file {archived.pl}, \file {bounced.pl} and \file {sympa.pl}.
     There are different ways to organize this :
\begin{itemize}
\item With some operating systems no special setup is required because
      wwsympa.fcgi is installed with suid and sgid bits, but this will not work
      if Suid scripts are refused by your system.

\item Run a dedicated Apache server with sympa.sympa as uid.gid (The Apache default
      is nobody.nobody)

\item Use a virtual Apache server with sympa.sympa as uid.gid ; apache
      needs to be compiled with suexec.

\item Otherwise, you can overcome restrictions on the execution of Suid scripts
      by using a short C program, owned by sympa and with the Suid bit set, to start
      \file {wwsympa.fcgi}. Here is an example (with no guarantee attached) :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}

#include <unistd.h>

#define WWSYMPA "/home/sympa/bin/wwsympa.fcgi"

int main(int argn, char **argv, char **envp) {
  execve(WWSYMPA,argv,envp);
}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Installing wwsympa.fcgi in your Apache server}
     If you chose to run \file {wwsympa.fcgi} as a simple CGI, you simply need to
     script alias it. 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
     Example :
       	ScriptAlias /wws /home/sympa/bin/wwsympa.fcgi
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

     Running  FastCGI will provide much faster responses from your server and 
     reduce load (to understand why, read 
     \htmladdnormallink 
     {http://www.fastcgi.com/fcgi-devkit-2.1/doc/fcgi-perf.htm}
     {http://www.fastcgi.com/fcgi-devkit-2.1/doc/fcgi-perf.htm})
     
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
     Example :
	FastCgiServer /home/sympa/bin/wwsympa.fcgi -processes 2
	<Location /wws>
   	  SetHandler fastcgi-script
	</Location>

	ScriptAlias /wws /home/sympa/bin/wwsympa.fcgi

 \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
    

\section {Database configuration}

\WWSympa needs an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) in order to
run. All database access is performed via the \Sympa API. \Sympa
currently interfaces with \htmladdnormallink {MySQL}
{http://www.mysql.net/}, \htmladdnormallink {PostgreSQL}
{http://www.postgresql.pyrenet.fr/}, \htmladdnormallink {Oracle}
{http://www.oracle.com/database/} and \htmladdnormallink {Sybase}
{http://www.sybase.com/index_sybase.html}.

A database is needed to store user passwords and preferences.
The database structure is documented in the \Sympa documentation ;
scripts for creating it are also provided with the \Sympa distribution
(in \dir {script}). 

User information (password and prefs) are stored in the «User» table.
User passwords stored in the database are encrypted using reversible
RC4 encryption controled with the \cfkeyword {cookie} parameter,
since \WWSympa might need to remind users of their passwords. 
The security of \WWSympa rests on the security of your database. 


\section {Sharing \WWSympa authentication with other applications}

You might want to make other web applications collaborate with \Sympa,
and share the same authentication system. \Sympa uses
HTTP cookies to carry users' auth information from page to page.
This cookie carries no information concerning privileges. To make your application
work with \Sympa, you have two possibilities :

\begin {itemize}

\item Delegating authentication operations to \WWSympa \\
If you want to avoid spending a lot of time programming a CGI to do Login, Logout
and Remindpassword, you can copy \WWSympa's login page to your 
application, and then make use of the cookie information within your application. 
The cookie format is :
\begin{verbatim}
user=<user_email>:<md5>
\end{verbatim}

where <user\_email> is the user's complete email address, and
<md5> is a MD5 checksum of the <user\_email>+\Sympa \cfkeyword {cookie}
configuration parameter.
Your application needs to know what the \cfkeyword {cookie} parameter
is, so it can check the HTTP cookie validity ; this is a secret shared
between \WWSympa and your application.
\WWSympa's \textit {loginrequest} page can be called to return to the
referer URL when an action is performed. Here is a sample HTML anchor :

\begin{verbatim}
<A HREF="/wws/loginrequest/referer">Login page</A>
\end{verbatim}


\item Using \WWSympa's HTTP cookie format within your auth module \\
To cooperate with \WWSympa, you simply need to adopt its HTTP
cookie format and share the secret it uses to generate MD5 checksums,
ie the \cfkeyword {cookie} configuration parameter. In this way, \WWSympa
will accept users authenticated through your application without
further authentication.


\end {itemize}

\chapter {Using \Sympa with an RDBMS}
\label {sec-rdbms}

It is possible for \Sympa to store its user information within
a Relational DataBase System. Currently you can use one of the following
DBMS : MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase. Interfacing with other RDBMS
requires only a few changes in the code, since the API used, 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot {DBI} {http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/} 
(DataBase Interface), has DBD (DataBase Drivers) for many DBMS.

\section {Prerequisites}

You need to have a DataBase System installed (not necessarily 
on the same host as \Sympa), and the client libraries for that
Database installed on the \Sympa host ; provided, of course, that
a Perl DBD (DataBase Driver) is available for your chosen DBMS!
Check the \htmladdnormallinkfoot
{DBI Module Availability} {http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/}.

\section {Installing Perl modules}

\Sympa will use DBI to communicate with the database system and
therefore requires the DBD for your database system. DBI and 
DBD::YourDB (Msql-Mysql-modules for MySQL) are distributed as 
CPAN modules. Refer to ~\ref 
{Install other required CPAN modules}, page~\pageref 
{Install other required CPAN modules} for installation
details of these modules.

\section {Creating a sympa DataBase}

\subsection {Database structure}

The sympa database structure is slightly different from the
structure of a \file {subscribers} file. A \file {subscribers}
file is a text file based on paragraphs (similar to 
the \file {config} file) ; each paragraph completely describes 
a subscriber. If somebody is subscribed to two lists, he/she 
will appear in both subscribers files.

The DataBase distinguishes information relative to a person (email,
real name, password) and his/her subscription options (list
concerned, date of subscription, reception option, visibility 
option). This results in a separation of the data into two tables :
the user\_table and the subscriber\_table, linked by a user/subscriber email.

\subsection {Database creation}

The \file {create\_db} script below will create the sympa database for 
you. You can find it in the \dir {script/} directory of the 
distribution (currently scripts are available for mysql, postgresql, Oracle and Sybase).

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}

## MySQL Database creation script
CREATE DATABASE sympa;

## Connect to DB 
\r sympa

CREATE TABLE user_table (
  	email_user          	varchar (100) NOT NULL,
  	gecos_user          	varchar (150),
  	password_user		varchar (40),
	cookie_delay_user	int,
	lang_user		varchar (10),
	PRIMARY KEY (email_user)
);

CREATE TABLE subscriber_table (
  	list_subscriber       	varchar (50) NOT NULL,
	user_subscriber		varchar (100) NOT NULL,
	date_subscriber		datetime NOT NULL,
	update_subscriber	datetime,
	visibility_subscriber	varchar (20),
	reception_subscriber	varchar (20),
	bounce_subscriber	varchar (30),
	comment_subscriber	varchar (150),
	PRIMARY KEY (list_subscriber, user_subscriber),
	INDEX (user_subscriber,list_subscriber)
);

\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

You can execute the script using a simple SQL shell such as
mysql or psql.

Example:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# mysql  < create_db.mysql
\end{verbatim}  
\end {quote}

\subsection {Importing data from subscribers files}

You might need to import subscriber data into the sympa database
from an older version of \Sympa. Simply edit the 
list configuration using \WWSympa (this requires listmaster privileges) 
and change the data source from \textbf {file} to \textbf {database}. 



\section {\Sympa configuration}

To store subscriber information in your newly created
database, you first need to tell \Sympa what kind of
database to work with, then you must configure
your list to access the database.

You define the database source in \file {sympa.conf} :
\cfkeyword {db\_type}, \cfkeyword {db\_name}, 
\cfkeyword {db\_host}, \cfkeyword {db\_user}, 
\cfkeyword {db\_passwd}.

If you are interfacing \Sympa with an Oracle database, 
\cfkeyword {db\_name} is the SID.

All your lists are now configured to use the database,
unless you set list parameter \lparam {user\_data\_source} 
to \textbf {file} or \textbf {include}. 

\Sympa will now extract and store user
information for this list using the database instead of the
\file {subscribers} file. Note however that subscriber information is 
dumped to \file {subscribers.db.dump} at every shutdown, 
to allow a manual rescue restart (by renaming subscribers.db.dump to
subscribers and changing the user\_data\_source parameter), if ever the
database were to become inaccessible.

\cleardoublepage
\chapter {\Sympa with S/MIME and HTTPS}
    \label {smime}

S/MIME is a cryptographic method for Mime messages based on X509 certificates.
Before installing \Sympa S/Mime features (which we call S/Sympa), you should be
under no illusion about what the S stands for : ``S/MIME'' means ``Secure MIME''.
That S certainly does not stand for ``Simple''.

The aim of this chapter is simply to describe what security level is provided
by \Sympa while
using S/MIME messages, and how to configure \Sympa for it. It is not intended
to teach anyone what S/Mime is and why it is so complex ! RFCs numbers 2311,
2312, 2632, 2633 and 2634, along with a lot of literature about S/MIME, PKCS\#7
and PKI is available on the Internet. \Sympa 2.7 is the first version of
\Sympa to include S/MIME features as beta-testing features.

\section {Signed message distribution}

No action required.
You probably imagine that any mailing list manager (or any mail forwarder)
is compatible with S/MIME signatures, as long as it respects the MIME structure of
incoming messages. You are right. Even Majordomo can distribute a signed message!
As \Sympa provides MIME compatibility, you don't need to do
anything in order to allow subscribers to verify signed messages distributed
through a list. This is not an issue at all, since any processes that
distribute messages  are compatible with end user
signing processes. Sympa simply skips the message footer attachment
(ref \ref {messagefooter}, page~\pageref {messagefooter}) to prevent any
body corruption which would break the signature.

\section {Use of S/MIME signature by Sympa itself}

Sympa is able to verify S/MIME signatures in order to apply S/MIME
authentication methods for message handling. 
Currently, this feature is limited to the
distribution process, and to any commands \Sympa might find in the message
body.  The reasons for this restriction are related to current S/MIME
usage.
S/MIME signature structure is based on the encryption of a digest of the
message. Most S/MIME agents do not include any part of the
message headers in the message digest, so anyone can modify the message
header without signature corruption! This is easy to do : for example, anyone
can edit a signed message with their preferred message agent, modify whatever
header they want (for example \texttt {Subject:} , \texttt {Date:} and
\texttt {To:}, and redistribute the message to a list or to the robot
without breaking the signature.

So we cannot apply the S/MIME
authentication method to a command parsed in the \texttt {Subject:} field of a
message or via the \texttt {-subscribe} or \texttt {-unsubscribe} email
address. 

\section {Use of S/MIME encryption} 

S/Sympa is not an implementation of the ``S/MIME Symmetric Key Distribution''
internet draft. This sophisticated scheme is required for large lists
with encryption. So, there is still some scope for future developments :) 


We assume that S/Sympa distributes message as received, ie unencrypted when the
list receives an unencrypted message, but otherwise encrypted.

In order to be able to send encrypted messages to a list, the sender needs
to use the X509 certificate of the list. Sympa will send an encrypted message
to each subscriber using the subscriber's certificate. To provide this feature,
\Sympa needs to manage one certificate for each list and one for each
subscriber. This is availible in Sympa version 2.8 and above.

\section {S/Sympa configuration} 

\subsection {Installation}
\label {smimeinstall}

The only requirement is openssl (http://www.openssl.org) version 0.9.5a and above.
OpenSSL is used by \Sympa as an external plugin
(like sendmail or postfix), so it must be installed with the appropriate access
(x for sympa.sympa). 

\subsection {configuration in sympa.conf}
\label {smimeconf}

S/Sympa configuration is very simple. If you are used to Apache SSL,
you should not feel lost. If you are an OpenSSL guru, you will
feel at home, and there may even be changes you will wish to suggest to us.
 
The basic requirement is to let \Sympa know where to find the binary file for openssl program
and the certificates of the trusted certificate authority. 
This is done using the optional parameters \unixcmd {openssl} and
\cfkeyword {trusted\_ca\_options}.
\begin{itemize}

  \item \cfkeyword {openssl} : the path for the openssl binary file,
         unsually \texttt {/usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl}
  \item \cfkeyword {trusted\_ca\_options} : the option used by openssl
        for trusted CA certificates. 
        The file \cfkeyword {/home/sympa/bin/etc/ca-bundle.crt} is distributed
        with Sympa and describes a well known set of CA's, such as the default Netscape
        navigator configuration. You can declare this set of certificates as trusted
        by setting \texttt {trusted\_ca\_options -CAfile /home/sympa/bin/etc/ca-bundle.crt}.
        You can also use the \cfkeyword {-CApath} \unixcmd {openssl} option, or both 
        \cfkeyword {-CApath} and \cfkeyword {-CAfile}. Example :       
        \texttt {trusted\_ca\_options -CApath /home/sympa/etc/ssl.crt -CAfile /home/sympa/bin/etc/ca-bundle.crt}.

	Both the \cfkeyword {-CAfile} file and the \cfkeyword {-CApath} directory
        should be shared with your Apache+mod\_ssl configuration. This is useful
	for the S/Sympa web interface.  Please refer to the Openssl documentation for details.
  \item \cfkeyword {key\_passord} : the password used to protect all list private keys. xxxxxxx	
\end{itemize}


\subsection {configuration to recognize S/MIME signatures}
\label {smimeforsign}

Once  \texttt {openssl} installed and  \texttt {sympa.conf} configured,
your S/Sympa is ready to use S/Mime signatures for any authentication operation. You simply need
to use the appropriate scenario for the operation you want to secure. 
(see \ref {scenarii}, page~\pageref {scenarii}).

When receiving a message, \Sympa applies
the scenario with the apropriate authentication method parameter.
In most cases the authentication method is ``\texttt {smtp}'', but in cases
whre the message is signed and the signature has been checked and matches the
sender email, \Sympa applies the ``\texttt {smime}'' authentication
method.

It is vital to ensure that if the scenario does not recoginize this authentication method, the
operation requested will be rejected. Consequently, scenarii distributed
prior to version 2.7 are not compatible with the OpenSSL configuration of Sympa. 
All
standard scenarii (those distributed with sympa)
now include the \texttt {smime} method. The following example is
named \texttt {send.private\_smime}, and restricts sends to subscribers using an S/mime signature :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
title.us restricted to subscribers check smime signature
title.fr limité aux abonnés, vérif de la signature smime

is_subscriber([listname],[sender])             smime  -> do_it
is_editor([listname],[sender])                 smime  -> do_it
is_owner([listname],[sender])                  smime  -> do_it
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

It as also possible to mix various authentication methods in a single scenario. The following
example, \texttt {send.private\_key}, requires either an md5 return key or an S/Mime signature :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
title.us restricted to subscribers with previous md5 authentication
title.fr réservé aux abonnés avec authentification MD5 préalable

is_subscriber([listname],[sender]) smtp          -> request_auth
true()                             md5,smime     -> do_it
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {distributing encrypted messages}
\label {smimeforencrypt}

In this section we describe S/Sympa encryption features. The goal is to use
S/MIME encryption for distribution of a message to subscribers whenever the message has been
received encrypted from the sender. 

Why is S/Sympa concerned by the S/MIME encryption distribution process ?
It is because encryption is performed using the \textbf {recepient} X509
certificate, whereas the signature require's the sender's private key. Thus, an encrypted
message can be read by the recepient only if he or she is the owner of the private
key associated with the certificate.
Consequently, the only way to encrypt a message for a list of recepients is
to encrypt and send the message for each recepient. This is what S/Sympa
does when distributing a encrypted message.

The S/Sympa encryption feature in the distribution process supposes that sympa
has received an encrypted message for some list. To be able to encrypt a message
for a list, the sender must have some access to an X509 certificate for the list.
So the first requirement is to install a certificate and a private key for
the list.
The mechanism whereby certificates are obtained and managed is complex. Current versions
of S/Sympa assume that list certificates and private keys are installed by
the listmaster.
It is a good idea to have a look at the OpenCA (http://www.openca.org)
documentation and/or PKI providers' web documentation.
You can use commercial certificates or home-made ones. Of course, the
certificat must be approved for email applications, and issued by one of
the trusted CA's described in the \cfkeyword {-CAfile} file or the
\cfkeyword {-CApath} OpenSSL option. 


The list private key must be installed in a file named
\tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/private\_key}. All the list private
keys must be encrypted using a single password defined by the
\cfkeyword {password} parameter in \cfkeyword {sympa.conf}.


\subsubsection {Use of Netscape navigator to obtain X509 list certificates}

In many cases e-mail X509 certificates are distributed via a web server and
loaded into the browser using your mouse :) Netscape allows
certificates to be exported to a file. So one way to get a list certificate is to obtain an e-mail
certificate for the canonical list adress in your brower, and then to export and install it for Sympa :
\begin {enumerate}
\item browse the net and load a certificate for the list adress on some
PKI provider (your own OpenCa pki server , thawte, verisign, ...). Be
careful :  the email certificate must be correspond exactly to the canonical adress of
your  list, otherwise, the signature will be incorrect (sender email will
not match signer email).
\item in the security menu, select the intended certificate and export
it. Netscape will prompt you for a password and a filename to encrypt
the output file. The format used by Netscape is  ``pkcs\#12''. 
Copy this file to the list home directory.
\item convert the pkcs\#12 file into a pair of pem files :
\cfkeyword {cert.pem} and \cfkeyword {private\_key} using
the \unixcmd {~sympa/bin/p12topem.pl} script. Use \unixcmd
{p12topem.pl -help} for details.
\item be sure that \cfkeyword {cert.pem} and \cfkeyword {private\_key}
are owned by sympa with ``r'' access.
\item As soon as a certificate is installed for a list, the list  home page
includes a new link to load the certificate to the user's brower, and the welcome
message is signed by the list.
\end {enumerate}

\chapter {Customizing \Sympa/\WWSympa}
    \label {customization}

\section {Template file format}
\label{tpl-format}
\index{templates format}

Template files within \Sympa and \WWSympa are text files containing 
programming elements (variables, conditions, loops, file inclusions)
that will be parsed in order to adapt to the runtime context. These 
templates are an extension of programs and therefore give access to 
a limited list of variables (those defined in the '\textit {hash}' 
parameter given to the parser). 

Review the Site template files (\ref {site-tpl}, page~\pageref {site-tpl}) 
and List template files (\ref {list-tpl}, page~\pageref {list-tpl}).

The following describes the syntactical elements of templates.

\subsection {Variables}

Variables are enclosed between brackets '\textit {[]}'. The variable name
is composed of alphanumerics (0-1a-zA-Z) or underscores (\_).
The syntax for accessing an element in a '\textit{hash}' is [hash-$>$elt].

\textit {Examples:} 
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
[url]
[is_owner]
[list->name]
[user->lang]
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

For each template you wish to customize, check the available variables in the
documentation.

\subsection {Conditions}

Conditions include variable comparisons (= and <>), or existence.
Syntactical elements for conditions are [IF xxx], [ELSE], [ELSIF xxx] and
[ENDIF].

\textit {Examples:} 
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
[IF  user->lang=fr]
Bienvenue dans la liste [list->name]
[ELSIF user->lang=es]
Bienvenida en la lista [list->name]
[ELSE]
Welcome in list [list->name]
[ENDIF]

[IF is_owner]
The following commands are available only 
for lists owners or moderators:
....
[ENDIF]
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {Loops}

Loops make it possible to traverse a list of elements (internally represented by a 
'\textit{hash}' or an '\textit{array}'). 

\texttt{Example :}
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
A review of public lists

[FOREACH l IN lists]
   [l->NAME] 
   [l->subject]
[END]
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\texttt {[elt-$>$NAME]} is a special element of the current entry providing 
the key in the '\textit{hash}' (in this example the name of the list). When traversing
an '\textit{array}', \texttt{[elt-$>$INDEX]} is the index of the current
entry.

\subsection {File inclusions}

You can include another file within a template . The specified file can be 
included as is, or itself parsed (there is no loop detection). The file 
path is either specified in the directive or accessed in a variable.

Inclusion of a text file :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
[INCLUDE 'archives/last_message']
[INCLUDE file_path]
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The first example includes a file whose relative path is \file {archives/last\_message}.
The second example includes a file whose path is in file\_path variable.

Inclusion and parsing of a template file :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
[PARSE 'welcome.tpl']
[PARSE file_path]
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The first example includes the template file \file {welcome.tpl}.
The second example includes a template file whose path is in file\_path variable.

\subsection {Stop parsing}

You may need to exclude certain lines in a template from the parsing
process. You can perform this by stopping and restarting the
parsing.

Escaping sensitive Javascript functions :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
<!-- for other browsers
  function toggle_selection(myfield) {
    for (i = 0; i < myfield.length; i++) {
    [STOPPARSE]
       if (myfield[i].checked) {
            myfield[i].checked = false;
       }else {
	    myfield[i].checked = true;
       }
    [STARTPARSE]
    }
  }
// end browsers -->
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}


\section {Site template files}
\label{site-tpl}
\index{templates, site}

These files are used by Sympa as service messages for the \mailcmd {HELP}, 
\mailcmd {LISTS} and \mailcmd {REMIND *} commands. These files are interpreted 
(parsed) by \Sympa and respect the template format ; every file has a .tpl extension. 
See \ref {tpl-format}, 
page~\pageref {tpl-format}. 

Sympa looks for these files in the following order (where $<$list$>$ is the
listname if defined, $<$action$>$ is the name of the command, and $<$lang$>$ is
the prefered language of the user) :
\begin {enumerate}
	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/$<$list$>$/$<$action$>$.$<$lang$>$.tpl}. 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/$<$list$>$/$<$action$>$.tpl}. 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/templates/$<$action$>$.$<$lang$>$.tpl}. 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/templates/$<$action$>$.tpl}. 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/templates/$<$action$>$.$<$lang$>$.tpl}.
	\item \tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/templates/$<$action$>$.tpl}.
\end {enumerate}

If the file starts with a From: line, it is considered as
a full message and will be sent (after parsing) without adding SMTP
headers. Otherwise the file is treated as a text/plain message body.

The following variables may be used in these template files :

\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [conf-$>$email] : sympa email address local part

	\item[-] [conf-$>$host] : sympa host name

	\item[-] [conf-$>$sympa] : sympa's complete email address

	\item[-] [conf-$>$wwsympa\_url] : \WWSympa root URL

	\item[-] [conf-$>$listmaster] : listmaster email addresses

	\item[-] [user-$>$email] : user email address

	\item[-] [user-$>$gecos] : user gecos field (usually his/her name)

	\item[-] [user-$>$password] : user password

	\item[-] [user-$>$lang] : user language	

\end {itemize}

\subsection {helpfile.tpl} 


	This file is sent in response to a \mailcmd {HELP} command. 
	You may use additional variables
\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [is\_owner] : TRUE if the user is list owner

	\item[-] [is\_editor] : TRUE if the user is list editor

\end {itemize}

\subsection {lists.tpl} 

	File returned by \mailcmd {LISTS} command. 
	An additional variable is available :
\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [lists] : this is a hashtable indexed by list names and
			containing lists' subjects. Only lists visible
			to this user (according to the \lparam {visibility} 
			list parameter) are listed.
\end {itemize}

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
These are the public lists for [conf->email]@[conf->host]

[FOREACH l IN lists]
	
 [l->NAME]: [l->subject]

[END]

\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {global\_remind.tpl} 

	This file is sent in response to a \mailcmd {REMIND *} command. 
	(see~\ref {cmd-remind}, page~\pageref {cmd-remind})
	You may use additional variables
\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [lists] : this is an array containing the listnames the user
			is subscribed to.
\end {itemize}

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}

This is a subscription reminder.

You are subscribed to the following lists :
[FOREACH l IN lists
	
 [l] : [conf->wwsympa\_url]/info/[l]

[END]

Your subscriber email : [user->email]
Your password : [user->password]

\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {your\_infected\_msg.tpl} 

This message is sent to warn the sender of a virus infected mail,
indicating the name of the virus found 
(see~\ref {Antivirus}, page~\pageref {Antivirus}).

\section {Web template files}
\label{web-tpl}
\index{templates, web}

You may define your own web template files, different from the standard
ones. \WWSympa first looks for list specific web templates, then for
site web templates, before falling back on its defaults. 

Your list web template files should be placed in the \tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/wws\_templates} 
directory ; your site web templates in \tildedir {sympa/expl/wws\_templates} directory.

\section {Internationalization}
\label {internationalization}
\index{internationalization}
\index{localization}

\Sympa was originally designed as a multilingual Mailing List
Manager. Even in its earliest versions, \Sympa separated messages from
the code itself, messages being stored in NLS catalogues (according 
to the XPG4 standard). Later a \lparam{lang} list parameter was introduced.
Nowadays \Sympa is able to keep track of individual users' language preferences.


\subsection {\Sympa internationalization}

Every message sent by \Sympa to users, owners and editors is outside
the code, in a message catalog. These catalogs are located in the
\tildedir{sympa/nls/} directory. Messages have currently been
translated into 6 different languages : 

\begin{itemize}

\item cn-big5: BIG5 Chinese (Honk Kong, Taiwan)

\item cn-gb: GB Chinese (Mainland China)

\item de: German

\item es: Spanish

\item fr: French

\item it: Italian

\item pl: Polish

\item us: US English

\end{itemize}

To tell \Sympa to use a particular message catalog, you can either set 
the \cfkeyword{lang} parameter in \file{sympa.conf}, or
set the \file{sympa.pl} \texttt{-l} option on the command line.

\subsection {List internationalization}

The \lparam{lang} list parameter defines the language for a list.
It is currently used by \WWSympa and to initialize users'
language preferences at subscription time.

In future versions, all messages returned by \Sympa concerning
a list should be in the list's language. 

\subsection {User internationalization}

The user language preference is currently used by \WWSympa
only. There is no email-based command for a user to set his/her
language. The language preference is initialized when the user
subscribes to his/her first list. \WWSympa allows the user to change 
it.

\section {Topics}
\label{topics}
\index{topics}

\WWSympa's homepage shows a list of topics for classifying
mailing lists. This is dynamically generated using the different lists'
\lparam {topics} configuration parameters. A list may appear 
in multiple categories.

The list of topics is defined in the \file {topics.conf} configuration
file, located in th \tildedir {sympa/etc} directory. The format of this file is 
as follows :
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
<topic1_name>
title	<topic1 title>
visibility <topic1 visibility>
....
<topicn_name/subtopic_name>
title	<topicn title>
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

You will notice that subtopics can be used, the separator being \textit {/}.
The topic name is composed of alphanumerics (0-1a-zA-Z) or underscores (\_).
The order in which the topics are listed is respected in \WWSympa's homepage.
The \textbf {visibility} line defines who can view the topic (now available for subtopics).
It refers to the associated topics\_visibility scenario.
You will find a sample \file {topics.conf} in the \dir {sample} 
directory ; NONE is installed as the default. 


\section {Scenarii}
    \label {scenarii}
    \index{scenario}

List parameters controling the behavior of commands are linked to different scenarii.
For example : the parameter \cfkeyword{send private} is related to the scenario send.private.
There are three possible locations for a scenario. When \Sympa seeks to apply a scenario, it
looks first in the related list directory \tildedir {sympa/expl/$<$list$>$/scenari}. If it
does not find the file there, it scans \tildedir {sympa/etc/scenari},
and finally \tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/scenari}, which is the directory intalled by the Makefile.

A scenario is a small configuration langage to describe who
can perform an operation and which authentication method is requested for it.
A scenario is an ordered set of rules. The goal is to provide a simple and
flexible way to configure authorization and authentication for each operation.


Each scenario rule contains :
\begin{itemize}
\item a condition : the condition is evaluated by \Sympa. It can use
  variables such as $[$sender$]$ for the sender email, $[$list$]$ for the listname etc.
\item an authentication method. The authentication method can be \cfkeyword {smtp},
\cfkeyword {md5} or \cfkeyword {smime}. The rule is applyed by \Sympa if both condition
and authentication method match the runtime context. \cfkeyword {smtp} is used if
\Sympa use the SMTP \cfkeyword {from:} header , \cfkeyword {md5} is used if a unique
md5 key as been returned by the requestor to validate her message, \cfkeyword {smime}
is used for signed messages (see \ref {smimeforsign}, page~\pageref {smimeforsign}).
\item a returned atomic action that will be executed by \Sympa if the rule matches

\end{itemize}

 
Example

\begin{quote}
del.auth
\begin{verbatim}
title.us deletion performed only by list owners, need authentication
title.fr suppression réservée au propriétaire avec authentification
title.es eliminación reservada sólo para el propietario, necesita autentificación


  is_owner([listname],[sender])  smtp       -> request_auth
  is_listmaster([sender])        smtp       -> request_auth
  true()                         md5,smime  -> do_it
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Scenari can also contain includes :

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
    subscribe
        include commonreject
        match([sender], /cru\.fr$/)          smtp,smime -> do_it
	true()                               smtp,smime -> owner
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
	    

In this case sympa applies recursively the scenario named \texttt {include.commonreject}
before introducing the other rules. This possibility was introduced in
order to facilitate the administration of common rules.

A bunch of scenari is provided with the \Sympa distribution ; it provides
all possible configurations as defined in previous releases of \Sympa
($<$= 2.3) whithout any change in your list configuration files. 

These standard scenari are located in the \tildedir {sympa/bin/scenari/}
directory. Default scenari are named <command>.default.

You may also define and name your own scenari. Store them in the
\tildedir {sympa/etc/scenari} directory. 
Example:

Copy the previous scenario to \file {scenari/subscribe.rennes1} :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
equal([sender], 'userxxx@univ-rennes1.fr') smtp,smime -> reject
match([sender], /univ-rennes1\.fr$/) smtp,smime -> do_it
true()                               smtp,smime -> owner
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

You may now refer to this scenario in any list configuration file, for example :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
subscribe rennes1
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

A scenario consists of rules, evaluated in order and starting with the first. 
Rules are defined as follows :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
<rule> ::= <condition> <auth\_list> -> <action>

<condition> ::= [!] <condition
		| true ()
                | equal (<var>, <var>)
                | match (<var>, /perl_regexp/)
                | is_subscriber (<listname>, <var>)
                | is_owner (<listname>, <var>)
                | is_editor (<listname>, <var>)
                | is_listmaster (<var>)
<var> ::= [email] | [sender] | [list-><list\_key\_word>] | [conf-><conf\_key\_word>] | [header-><smtp\_key\_word>] |  <string>

<listname> ::= [listname] | <listname_string>

<auth\_list> ::= <auth>,<auth\_list> | <auth>

<auth> ::= smtp|md5|smime

<action> ::=   do_it [,notify]
             | do_it [,quiet]
             | reject
             | request_auth
             | owner

<list\_key\_word> ::= name | host | lang | max\_size | priority | reply\_to | 
		      status | subject | account | 

<conf\_key\_word> ::= host | email | listmaster | default\_list\_priority | 
		      sympa\_priority | request\_priority | lang | max\_size
	 	      
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

perl\_regexp can containt the string [host] (it will be interpreted at run time as the list or robot domain.
The variable notation [header-$>$<smtp\_key\_word>] is interpreted as the SMTP header value only when performing
the sending message scenario. It can be use for exemple to ask editor validation for multipart messages.

%[idees de scenario]

\section {Loop detection}
    \label {loop-detection}
    \index{loop-detection}

\Sympa uses multiple tools to avoid loops in Mailing lists

First it rejects messages that either come from a robot (based on the
From: and other header fields) or messages that contain commands.

Every message sent by \Sympa includes a X-Loop header field set to
the listname. If the message comes back, \Sympa will detect that
it has already been sent (unless X-Loop header fields have been
erased).

\Sympa keeps track of Message IDs and will refuse to send multiple
message with the same message ID in the same mailing list.

At last \Sympa can detect loops due to command reports. 
Example of loop:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
1 - X sends a command to Sympa
2 - Sympa sends a command report to X
3 - X has installed a home-made vacation program replying to programs
4 - Sympa processes the reply and sends a report
5 - Looping to step 3
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\Sympa keeps track of each reports sent to an address in an internal counter.
The loop detection algorithm is :

\begin {itemize}

	\item Increment the counter

	\item If we are within the sampling period (as defined by
	\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_sampling\_delay} parameter)

	\begin {itemize}
		\item Then, if the counter exceeds the 
		\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_max} parameter then 
		don't send the report and notify the listmaster

		\item Else, start a new sampling period and reinitialize
		the counter,  ie multiply it by the 
		\cfkeyword {loop\_command\_decrease\_factor} parameter
	\end {itemize}


\end {itemize}

\chapter {Mailing list definition}
    \label {ml-creation}

The mailling list creation tool is Sympa's web interface. However this
web feature is available only from 2.7 release. Previous  version users
have to create new lists with there favorit text file editor.  

This chapter describe how to create mailing list without using
web tools. See~\ref {web-ml-creation}, page~\pageref {web-ml-creation} to
do it using WWSympa, you will do it in a easier way.

To create a mailing list, only system mail aliases modification requires
system privileges. Other tasks will be carried out under \texttt
{sympa} UID in order to guarantee that the files created have the
right permissions.


\begin {itemize}
        \item add aliases in alias file

        \item create the list directory  \tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist}

        \item create configuration file in \tildedir
            {sympa/expl/\samplelist} directory

        \item create  customized message files (welcome, bye, removed
          remind, message.header, message.footer) if needed ; you probably need at least the
          welcome.

\end {itemize}


\section {Mail aliases}
    \label {list-aliases}
    \index{aliases}
    \index{mail aliases}

For each new list, it is necessary to create three mail aliases
(the location of the \unixcmd {sendmail} alias file varies from
one system to another).

For example, to create the \mailaddr {\samplelist} list, the following
aliases must be added:

\begin {quote}
    \tt
    \begin {tabular} {ll}
        \mailaddr {\samplelist}:         &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/queue \samplelist"
            \\
        \mailaddr {\samplelist-request}: &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/queue \samplelist-request"
            \\
        \mailaddr {\samplelist-editor}:  &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/queue \samplelist-editor"
            \\
        \mailaddr {\samplelist-owner}:   &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/bouncequeue \samplelist
            \\
        \mailaddr {\samplelist-subscribe}:   &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/queue \samplelist-subscribe"
            \\
        \mailaddr {\samplelist-unsubscribe}: &
            "|/home/sympa/bin/queue \samplelist-unsubscribe"
            \\

    \end {tabular}
\end {quote}

%This example demonstrates how to define a list with the low priority
%level 2. Messages for editor and owner will be processed by \Sympa
%with greater priority (level 1) than messages to the list itself.

The address \mailaddr {\samplelist-request} should be the address
of the person in charge of \mailaddr {\samplelist} list management
(the list \textindex {owner}).  \Sympa will forward messages for
\mailaddr {\samplelist-request} to the owner of list \mailaddr
{\samplelist} defined in \tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/config}
file.  This feature avoids later changes to this alias when updating
owner's addresses.

The address \mailaddr {\samplelist-editor} can be used as \mailaddr
{\samplelist-request} to contact the list editors if defined in
\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/config}.  This address definition
is not mandatory.

The address \mailaddr {\samplelist-owner} is the address receiving
non-delivery reports. \file {bouncequeue} program stores these messages 
in \dir {queuebounce} directory. \WWSympa ((see~\ref {wwsympa}, page~\pageref {wwsympa}) may then analyze them and provide a web access to them.

The address \mailaddr {\samplelist-subscribe} is for a fast and
easy to explain subscription. Be carefull: subscription is so easy
that spammer may subscribe by accident.

The address \mailaddr {\samplelist-unsubscribe} is for simple
unsubscription. By the way, everything that simplifies unsubscription
simplifies list administration.


\section {List directory}
\label {list-directory}

Each list has its own directory which name defines the list name. We
recommend to create it with the same name as the alias. This directory is
located in the \tildedir {sympa/expl} according to \cfkeyword{home}
defined in \file {/etc/sympa.conf} file.

Here is a list of files/directories you may find in the list's directory :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
archives/
bye.tpl
config
info
invite.tpl
homepage
message.header
message.footer
reject.tpl
remind.tpl
removed.tpl
stats
subscribers
welcome.tpl
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\section {List configuration file}
    \label {exp-config}


The configuration file for the \mailaddr {\samplelist} list is named
\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/config}. \Sympa reads it into memory
the first time the list is referred to. This file is not rewritten by 
\Sympa; as a result, it is possible to put comment lines in it. 
It is possible to change this file when the program is running. 
Changes are then taken into account the next time the list is
accessed. Be careful to provide read access for \Sympa on this file !

You will find a few configuration files in \dir {sample} directory. Copy
one of them to \tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/config} and customize it.

List configuration parameters are reviewed in list creation section, \ref {list-configuration-param}, page~\pageref {list-configuration-param}.

\section {Examples of configuration files}

This first example is for a list open to everyone:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
subject First example (an open list)

visibility noconceal

owner
email Pierre.David@prism.uvsq.fr

send public

review public
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The second example is for a moderated list with authentified subscription:
\index{moderation}
\index{authentication}

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
subject Second example (a moderated list)

visibility noconceal

owner
email moi@ici.fr

editor
email big.prof@ailleurs.edu

send editor

subscribe auth

review owner

reply_to_header
value list

cookie 142cleliste
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The third example is for a moderated list, with subscription
controlled by the owner, and running in digest mode. Subscribers
who are in \textindex {digest} mode receive the mail on Monday and
Thursday.

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
owner
email moi@ici.fr

editor
email prof@ailleurs.edu

send editor

subscribe owner

review owner

reply_to_header
value list

digest 1,4 12:00
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\section {Subscribers file}
    \label {file-subscribers}
    \index{subscriber file}

\textbf {WARNING}: \Sympa will not use this file if the list is configured in \texttt {include} or \texttt {database} \lparam{user\_data\_source}.

The \tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/subscribers} file is created and is
automatically filled in. It contains information about list
subscribers.  It is not advisable to edit this file.  Main parameters
are:

\begin {itemize}
    \item \lparam {email} \textit {address}

        Email address of subscriber.

    \item  \lparam {gecos} \textit {data} 

        Information about subscriber (family name, first name,
        etc.) This parameter is optional on signing up.

    \item \lparam {reception}
            \texttt {nomail} $|$
            \texttt {digest} $|$
            \texttt {summary}
        \label {par-reception} 

        Special receive mode for emails that the subscriber has
        selected. The mode can be either \textit {nomail},  \textit
        {digest} or \textit {summary}.  In normal receive mode, the receive attribute
        no longer appears for this subscriber.  See the \mailcmd
        {SET~LISTNAME~SUMMARY} (\ref {cmd-setsummary}, 
        page~\pageref {cmd-setsummary}) ,
        or \mailcmd {SET~LISTNAME~NOMAIL} command (\ref {cmd-setnomail},
        page~\pageref {cmd-setnomail}), and the \lparam {digest}
        parameter (\ref {par-digest}, page~\pageref {par-digest}).

    \item \lparam {visibility} \texttt {conceal}  
        \label {par-visibility-conceal}

        Special mode which allows subscriber to be invisible when
        there is a \mailcmd {REVIEW} command in the list.  If this
        parameter does not exist, the subscriber remains visible
        by \mailcmd {REVIEW}.  Note: this option does not affect
        the results of a \mailcmd {REVIEW} command issued by an
        owner.  See the \mailcmd {SET~LISTNAME~MAIL} command (\ref
        {cmd-setconceal}, page~\pageref {cmd-setconceal}) for
        details.

\end {itemize}


\section {Info file}

\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/info} should contain a detailed text
description of the list. If is used by \mailcmd {INFO} command. 
It can also be referenced from template files for service messages.

\section {Homepage file}

\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/homepage} is the HTML text 
on the \WWSympa info page for the list.

\section {List template files}
\label{list-tpl}
\index{templates, list}

These files are used by Sympa as service messages for commands such as
\mailcmd {SUB}, \mailcmd {ADD}, \mailcmd {SIG}, \mailcmd {DEL}, \mailcmd {REJECT}. 
These files are interpreted (parsed) by \Sympa and respect the template 
format ; every file has the .tpl extension. See \ref {tpl-format}, 
page~\pageref {tpl-format}. 

Sympa looks for these files in the following order :
\begin {enumerate}
 	\item \tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/<file>.tpl} 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/etc/templates/<file>.tpl}. 
	\item \tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/templates/<file>.tpl}.
\end {enumerate}

If the file starts with a From: line it is considered as
a full message and will be sent (after parsing) without adding SMTP
headers. Else file is taken as a text/plain message body.

The following variables may be used in list template files :

\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [conf-$>$email] : sympa email address local part

	\item[-] [conf-$>$host] : sympa host name

	\item[-] [conf-$>$sympa] : sympa's complete email address

	\item[-] [conf-$>$wwsympa\_url] : \WWSympa root URL

	\item[-] [conf-$>$listmaster] : listmaster email addresses

	\item[-] [list-$>$name] : list name

	\item[-] [list-$>$host] : list hostname

	\item[-] [list-$>$lang] : list language

	\item[-] [list-$>$subject] : list subject

	\item[-] [list-$>$owner] : list owners table hash

	\item[-] [user-$>$email] : user email address

	\item[-] [user-$>$gecos] : user gecos field (usually his/her name)

	\item[-] [user-$>$password] : user password

	\item[-] [user-$>$lang] : user language
	

\end {itemize}

You may also dynamically include a file from a template using the
[INCLUDE] directive.


\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Dear [user->email],

Welcome to list [list->name.@[list->host].

Presentation of the list :
[INCLUDE 'info']

Owners of liste [list->name] are :
[FOREACH ow IN list->owner]
   [ow->gecos] <[ow->email]>
[END]


\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {welcome.tpl} 

\Sympa will send a welcome message for each subscription. The welcome 
message can be customized for each list.

\subsection {bye.tpl} 

Sympa will send an unsubscription message for each received SIGNOFF 
mail command.

\subsection {removed.tpl} 

This message is sent to users that have been deleted (using \mailcmd {DELETE} 
command) from the list by the list owner.

\subsection {reject.tpl} 

\Sympa will send a reject message to the sender of a message that is rejected
by the list editor. If the editor prefixe the \mailcmd {REJECT} with the
keyword QUIET, the reject message is not sent.

\subsection {invite.tpl} 

This message is sent to users that have been invited (using \mailcmd {INVITE} 
command) to subscribe to a list. 

You may use additional variables
\begin {itemize}

	\item[-] [requested\_by] : email of the person who sent the 
		\mailcmd{INVITE} command

	\item[-] [url] : the mailto: URL to subscribe to the list

\end {itemize}

\subsection {remind.tpl}

This file contains a message which is sent to each subscriber
when one of the list owners sends the command \mailcmd {REMIND}
 (see~\ref {cmd-remind}, page~\pageref {cmd-remind}).

\subsection {summary.tpl}

Template for summaries (reception mode close to digest), 
see~\ref {cmd-setsummary}, page~\pageref {cmd-setsummary}.

\section {Stats file}
    \label {stats-file}
    \index{statistics}

\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/stats} is a text file containing 
statistics about the list. These informations are numerics separated
by white spaces within a single line :

\begin {itemize}

	\item Number of messages sent, used to generate X-sequence headers

	\item Number of messages X nb recipients 

	\item Number of bytes X nb messages

	\item Number of bytes X nb messages X nb recipients

	\item Number of subscribers

\end {itemize}

\section {Message header and footer} 
\label {messagefooter}

You may create \tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/message.header} and
\tildefile {sympa/expl/\samplelist/message.footer} files. Their content
is added, either at the beginning or at the end of each message 
before the distribution process. 

\lparam {footer\_type} list parameter defines whether to attach the 
header/footer content as a MIME part (except for multipart/alternative 
messages) or to append them to the message body (if a text/plain message).

\subsection {Archives directory}    

\tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/archives/} directory contains the 
archived  messages if the list is archived, see \ref {par-archive}, 
page~\pageref {par-archive}. The files are named in accordance with the 
frequency of archiving defined with the \lparam {archive} parameter.

\chapter {Creating and editing mailing using the web}
    \label {web-ml-creation}

The mailing list management by list owners process is designed for
web interface. It is based on strict definition of privileges of
listmaster, main list owner and basic list owner. The goal is to
allow each listmaster to define who can create a list and what
parameter can be set by owners. Therefore, a complete
installation need some effort on the configaration side, though defaults
are acceptable for most sites.

Some features are allready available, others will be soon, this is mentioned 
in this documention.

\section {List creation}

Lismasters have all privileges. Currently it
is defined in \file {sympa.conf} but in the future, it might be possible to
define one listmaster per virtual robot. As the default behaviour, newly created
lists are activated by listmaster ; list creation is available to any intranet user 
(ie : users with an email address within the same domain as Sympa).
This is controlled by \cfkeyword {create\_list} scenario.

\subsection {create\_list scenario}

This scenario can apply any condition about the [sender]
(ie: WWSympa user), and it must return \cfkeyword {reject}, \cfkeyword {do\_it}
or \cfkeyword {listmaster}.
The "create" button is available from the main menu only if the user is
allowed by the create\_list scenario.
If the scenario returns \cfkeyword {do\_it}, the list will be created and installed ;
if it returns "listmaster", the user is allowed to create a list but
the list is created with the \cfkeyword {pending} status
and only owner of the list can view or use it. In order to
install or reject new list, the listmaster need to open the list of pending lists
using the "pending list" button on the "server admin"
menu. Then he can install or reject pending lists.

\subsection {typical list profile}

Many different usages are possible for mailing list. \Sympa proposes a
large set of parameters for each list in order to adapt the list's behaviour
to any kind of usage. It may be difficult for users to choose any of the
list parameters to define a list profile. So the create list form just asks
the list creator to choose a profile for his/her list and complete it with
owner email, list subject and short list description.

The list profiles can be stored in \tildedir {sympa/etc/create\_list\_templates} or
\tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/create\_list\_templates} which come with Sympa's
distribution and should not be modified.  
\tildedir {sympa/etc/create\_list\_templates} which will not be
overwritten by make install and is intended to contain site customization.


A list profile is nearly a list configuration but some fields such as owner email
will be replaced by WWSympa et installation time. It is easy to create new list 
templates by modifying an existing one. Contributions to the distribution are welcome.

You might want to hide or modify profiles (unusefull or dangerous 
for your site). If a profile exists both in the local site directory
\tildedir {sympa/etc/create\_list\_templates} and
\tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/create\_list\_templates} directory, then the local profile 
will be used by WWSympa. 

Another way to control publically available profiles is to
edit \cfkeyword {create\_list.conf} file (the default for this file is in
\tildedir {sympa/bin/etc/} directory and you can create one in \tildedir {sympa/etc/}).
This allows to list available list templates. Example :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# Dont allow the public_anonymous profile
public_anonymous hidden
* read
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


When a list is created, whatever is it's status \cfkeyword {pending} or
\cfkeyword {open}, the owner can use WWSympa admin features to modify the list
parameters (in futur version) or to edit welcome message and so on.

WSYympa keeps creation and modification authors and date in the list's
\file {config} file (previous configuration file are saved).

\subsection {creating list alias}

If you defined an alias\_manager in \file {wwsympa.conf} 
(see \ref {alias-manager}, page~\pageref {alias-manager}), \WWSympa
will run this script for installing aliases. You can write your
own alias\_manager script, adapted to your MTA or mail configuration,
as far as it recognises the same set of parameters.

\section {List edition}
\label {list-edition}

For each parameter, you can choose via \tildefile {sympa/etc/edit\_list.conf}
configuration file who can edit list parameters ; the default 
\tildefile {sympa/bin/etc/edit\_list.conf} is reasonnably safe.

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
     examples :

         \# only listmaster can edit user\_data\_source, priority, ...
         user\_data\_source listmaster  

         priority listmaster
      
         \# only privileged owner can modify  editor parameter, send, ...
         editor privileged\_owner

         send privileged\_owner

         \# other parameters can be changed by simple owners
         default owner
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

      Privileged owners are defined in list's \file {config} file as follows :
	\begin {quote}
	\begin{verbatim}
		owner
		email his@email
      		profile privileged
	\end{verbatim}
	\end {quote}

      The following rules are hardcoded in wwsympa :
\begin {itemize}

\item listmaster is privileged owner of any list 

\item listmaster is the only one who can edit the "profile privileged"
      owner attribut. 

\item owner can edit there own attibut (except profile and email)

\item when creating a new list the requestor is privileged owner

\item privileged owner can edit any gecos,reception,info attribut
of any owner

\item privileged owner can edit owner's emails (unless the owner he is
editing is privileged)

\end {itemize}

      The goal is to define two trust level for owners (some can just 
      edit gadget like "custom\_subject", some others can edit important
      parameters, but keep control of crutial parameters like 
      the list of privileged owners or user\_data\_sources. So owners can change
      there e-mail (asking to a privileged owner to do it), but they can't
      give away the list mangement responsability to someone else without
      refering to listmaster.

\cleardoublepage
\chapter {List configuration parameters}
    \label {list-configuration-param}


The configuration file is made up of paragraphs separated by empty
lines and introduced by a keyword.

% [sa] Incomplet, énumération mal présentée et non cliquable
% [pda] : c'est maintenant cliquable. Pour la présentation, on verra plus tard, lorsque ce sera complet

However the number of parameters is important, the minimal list
definition is very short, only  \lparam {owner} and \lparam {subject}
parameter are needed  because all the other parameter have a default value.

\begin {quote}
    \textit {keyword value}
\end {quote}

\textbf {WARNING}: configuration parameters must be separated by
empty lines and EMPTY LINES ONLY !

\section {List description}

\subsection {editor}
    \label {par-editor}
    \index{moderation}

The \file {config} file contains one \lparam {editor} paragraph
per \textindex {moderator} (or editor).

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
editor
email Pierre.David@prism.uvsq.fr
gecos Pierre (Université de Versaille St Quentin)
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The editor of a list is the only one authorized to send messages
in the list when the \lparam {send} parameter (see~\ref {par-send},
page~\pageref {par-send}) is set to \lparam {editor}.\lparam
{editorkey} or \lparam {editorkeyonly}
This parameter is used also to redistribute mail in some other situation
( \lparam {privateoreditorkey} ).

The syntax of this directive is the same as that of the \lparam
{owner} parameter (see~\ref {par-owner}, page~\pageref {par-owner}),
even when several moderators are defined.

\subsection {host}
 \label {par-host}
 \index{host}

	\default {\cfkeyword {host} robot parameter}

\lparam {host} \textit {fully-qualified-domain-name}

Domain name hosting the list (used for \rfcheader {From} , for
example).Default value is set in
 \file {/etc/sympa.conf} file.

\subsection {lang}
    \label {par-lang}

	\default {\cfkeyword {lang} robot parameter}

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
lang cn-big5
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

This parameter defines the language used for the list. It is
exploited to initialize user's lang preference ; \Sympa command
reports are extracted from the associated messages catalog.

See \ref {internationalization}, page~\pageref {internationalization}
for available langages.

\subsection {owner}
    \label {par-owner}


The \file {config} file contains one \lparam {owner} paragraph per owner. 

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
owner
email serge.aumont@cru.fr
gecos C.R.U.
info Tel: 02 99 76 45 34
reception nomail
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

The list owner is usually the person who has the authorization to send
\mailcmd {ADD} (see~\ref {cmd-add}, page~\pageref {cmd-add}) and
\mailcmd {DELETE} (see~\ref {cmd-delete}, page~\pageref {cmd-delete})
commands on behalf of other users.

When the \lparam {subscribe} parameter (see~\ref {par-subscribe},
page~\pageref {par-subscribe}) specifies a restricted list, the
owner is the only one who has the capability to subscribe users.
In this case, \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE} requests are forwarded to him.

There may be several owners of a single list; in this case, each
owner is defined by a paragraph introduced by the \lparam {owner}
keyword.

The \lparam {owner} directive is followed by one or several lines
giving details regarding the owner's characteristics:

\begin {itemize}
    \item  \lparam {email} \textit {address}

        Owner's email address

    \item  \lparam {reception nomail}

        Optional attribute for an owner who don't want to receive
        mails.  Useful to define an owner with multiple email
        addresses: they are all recognized when \Sympa receives
        mail, but only some of them are recipient of administrative
        mail from \Sympa.

    \item  \lparam {gecos} \textit {data}

        Public information on the owner

    \item \lparam {info} \textit {data}

	Available since release 2.3

	Private information on the owner

    \item \lparam {profile} \texttt {privileged} $|$
	                    \texttt {normal}

	Available since release 2.3.5

	Profile of the owner. This is currently used to restrict
	access to some feature in WWSympa such as adding new owners
	to a list.

\end {itemize}

\subsection {subject}
    \label {par-subject}

\lparam {subject} \textit {subject-of-the-list}

This parameter indicates the subject of the list, which is sent in
response to the \mailcmd {LISTS} mail command. The subject is
a free form text limited to one line.
This parameter is \emph {not} used by \Sympa if \tildefile
{sympa/expl/lists} file exists (e.g.  static list of lists).

\subsection {topics}
    \label {par-topics}

\lparam {topics} computing/internet,education/university

This parameter allows classification of lists. You may define multiple 
topics as well as hierarchical ones. \WWSympa's list of public lists 
uses this parameter.

\subsection {visibility }
    \label {par-visibility}

	\default {conceal}

	\scenarized {visibility}

\lparam {visibility}
    \texttt {conceal} $|$
    \texttt {noconceal}

This parameter indicates whether the list should be listed when
replying to \mailcmd {LISTS} command.  This parameter is \emph {not}
used by \Sympa if \tildefile {sympa/expl/lists} file exists
(e.g. static list of lists).


\section {Data source related}

\subsection {user\_data\_source}

    	\label {par-user-data-source}
	\index{user-data-source}

	\default {file|database, if using a DBMS}

\lparam {user\_data\_source}
   \texttt {file} $|$
   \texttt {database} $|$
   \texttt {include}

Sympa allows the mailing list manager to choose how \Sympa loads
subscribers' data. Subscriber's informations can be stored in a text 
file, in a RDBMS or included from various external sources (list,
flat file, LDAP directory, RDBMS).

\begin {itemize}
\item  \lparam {user\_data\_source} \texttt {file}

       When this value is used subscribers data
       are stored in a file which name is define \file
       {sympa.conf}, parameter \cfkeyword {subscribers}.
       This is maintened for backwared compatibility.

\item  \lparam {user\_data\_source} \texttt {database} 

       This mode as been introduced to store data in a RDBMS 
       in order to share subscribers data with a HTTP interface 
       and also to be able to manage very large mailing lists 
       (tested with MySql, 200.000 subscribers in a single list). 
       We strongly recommend to use this value (and of course to
       configure a RDBMS). This improve Sympa performence and solve
       possible conflict with sympa and wwsympa.
        Please refer to the 
       section \"Using \Sympa with a RDBMS\" 
       (\ref {sec-rdbms}, page~\pageref {sec-rdbms}).

\item \lparam {user\_data\_source} \texttt {include} 
       
       Subscribers list is not define by email enumeration 
       but by subscriber properties. Include can be performed 
       by extracting emails using a SQL or LDAP query or 
       by including other mailing lists. Compulsary include 
       paragraphs are needed (at least one), each defining a
       data source. These paragraphs' name can be one of
       \lparam {include\_file}, \lparam {include\_list}, 
	\lparam {include\_sql\_query} or \lparam {include\_ldap\_query}. 
\end {itemize}


\subsection {ttl}

    	\label {ttl}
	\index{ttl}

	\default {3600}

\lparam {ttl} \texttt {delay\_in\_seconds} 

\Sympa caches users data extracted using the include parameter.

list. You can include any list whatever is
its  \lparam {user\_data\_source} definition. In particular, you can
include lists which are also defined by inclusion of other lists. 
Be carefull not to include list \texttt {A} in list \texttt {B} and
then list \texttt {B} in list \texttt {A} : this would start an 
infinite loop.

\section {Commands' behaviour}

\subsection {subscribe}
    \label {par-subscribe}

	\default {open}

	\scenarized {subscribe}

Subscribe parameter define the rules for subscribing to the list. 
Predefined scenari are :

\lparam {subscribe}

    \texttt {closed} $|$
    \texttt {auth} $|$


\begin {itemize}
    \item \lparam {subscribe} \texttt {open}[\texttt {\_notify}]

          Anyone can join the list with the \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE}
          mail command. Optional notification of each succesful
          subscription to owners can be set for each list with:

          \texttt {subscribe open\_notify}.

    \item \lparam {subscribe} \texttt {owner}

          Only the owner (see \lparam {owner} above) can subscribe
          or unsubscribe a user. The owner should send an \mailcmd
          {ADD} mail command to subscribe the user.

    \item \lparam {subscribe} \texttt {closed}

          Any subscription is refused, except indirectly by the
          owner using the \mailcmd {ADD} command (see~\ref {cmd-add},
          page~\pageref {cmd-add}). This parameter is forced to
          \texttt {closed} value for lists defined using
          \lparam {user\_data\_source}\texttt {include}.
          

    \item \lparam {subscribe} \texttt {auth}[\texttt {\_notify}]

        Use of the \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE} command requires prior
        \textindex {authentication} of the origin of the subscription
        request. \Sympa sends a key to the requesting party, who
        should in return send \Sympa a \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE} command
        prefixed with \lparam {auth}~\textit {key}.

        Note: The \lparam {cookie} parameter (see~\ref {par-cookie},
        page~\pageref {par-cookie}) allows allocation of a single
        key.


\end {itemize}

        sends a key, indicating that the ``\lparam {auth}~\textit
        {key}'' parameter should be put in front of the command.

        Note: it is advisable to enter the \lparam {cookie} parameter
        (see~\ref {par-cookie}, page~\pageref {par-cookie}).

    \item \lparam {unsubscribe} \texttt {closed}

        sends a key, indicating that the ``\lparam {auth}~\textit
        {key}'' parameter should be put in front of the command.

    \item \lparam {unsubscribe} \texttt {closed}
      
         \mailcmd {ADD} is not allowed. This parameter is forced to

        {key}'' parameter should be put in front of the command.

    \item \lparam {DEL} \texttt {closed}
      
         \mailcmd {DEL} is not allowed. This parameter is forced to
        \texttt {closed} value for lists defined using \lparam

This parameter specifies who can send messages to the list ; it is performed by scenari :

\begin {itemize}
    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {public} 

        Anyone can send a message to the list, including non-subscribers.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {publickey} 

        Anyone can send a message to the list, including non-subscribers;
        \textindex {authentication} is automatically requested by return mail.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {private}

        Only subscribers or owners can send a message.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {privatekey}

        Only subscribers or owners can send a message; \textindex
        {authentication}
        is systematically requested by return mail.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {privateorpublickey} 

        Anyone can send a message to the list. Authentication is
        requested by return mail for non-subscribers.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {privateoreditorkey} 

        Anyone can send a message to the list. Message for which
        the sender is not a subscriber are sent to the list editor
        to confirm or reject its distribution.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {editorkeyonly}

        All messages are stored on the server awaiting approval
        for distribution. An enabling key is sent to the moderators
        wit a copy of the message. The message is distributed when
        the \Sympa robot receives a \mailcmd {DISTRIBUTE} command
        with the sole key referring to the queued message.

        The \mailcmd {REJECT} command delete the message from the
        \textindex {moderation} spool (see \cfkeyword {queuemod}
        configuration variable).

        This method is used for:

        \begin {itemize}
            \item rather sure identification of the \textindex
                {moderator}

            \item total independence of moderation mode in
                relation to mail user agent (MUA) type used by
                moderators

            \item Minimum cooperation between moderators in the
                case of sharing of this responsibility.

        \end {itemize}

        With this method, it is not possible for the \textindex
        {moderator} to change the message, which is always refused
        or distributed as a whole. This moderation feature is only
        available as of release 1.2.0 of \Sympa.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {editor}

        In this configuration, \Sympa distributes the messages for
        which at least one of the SMTP fields \rfcheader {From},
        \rfcheader {X-Sender} contains
        the address of one of the moderators, distributing these
        in the list (see \lparam {editor} parameter for list
        description file, \ref {par-editor}, page~\pageref
        {par-editor}).

        In the opposite case, it sends these list moderators a
        message entitled ``\textit {Article to moderate}'' containing
        a copy of the article to be distributed. It is up to the
        \textindex {moderator} to send this copy of the message to
        be distributed back to the list, using the redirect,
        redistribute, forward or other functions from its MUA
        (moderation depends on processing of headers, managed by
        each MUA).

        It should be noted that the security level of this method
        is associated to the enabling level of the message SMTP
        fields; it is therefore rather low.

    \item \lparam {send} \texttt {editorkey}

        This method mixes \lparam {send editor} and \lparam {send
        editorkeyonly} functionalities: If one of the SMTP fields
        \rfcheader {From}, \rfcheader {X-Sender} or \rfcheader
        {Approved} contains the address of one of the moderators,
        the message is distributed without any control.

        In the opposite case, it works in the same way as a moderated
        list with \lparam {send editorkeyonly}.

        Available as of release 1.2.0 of \Sympa.

	This parameter indicates whether the \rfcheader {Reply-To} field
	should point to the sender of the message (\texttt {sender}), to
	the list itself (\texttt {list}) or to anyother e-mail (defined by
	\lparam {other\_email} parameter).

Note: it is unadvisable to change this field, especially to point
to the list. Experience demonstrates that numerous users, thinking
they are responding to the sender, send private messages to a list.
This can lead to an embarrassing situation.


\item \lparam {other\_email} \textit {an\_email\_address}

	If \lparam {value} was set to \texttt {other\_email}, this parameter
	defines the email address used.

\item \lparam {apply}   \texttt {respect} $|$

added to a message.

\begin {itemize}
\item  \lparam {footer\_type} \texttt {mime}

       This is the default value. Sympa will add properly the
       footer/header as a new MIME part. If message if
       multipart/alternative, nothing is added (would require another
       level of MIME encapsulation).


\item  \lparam {footer\_type} \texttt {append} 

        In this configuration, sympa won't create new MIME parts but
        will try to append the header/footer to the body of the
        message. \tildefile
        {sympa/expl/\samplelist/message.footer.mime} will be

is sent to the subscribers in accordance with the rythm selected
with this parameter.

\textit {Daylist} designates a list of days in the week in number
format (from 0 for Sunday to 6 for Saturday), separated by commas.

\example {digest 1,2,3,4,5 15:30} 

In this example, \Sympa sends digests at 3:30 PM from Monday to Friday.

\textbf {WARNING}: if the sending time is too late, \Sympa may not
be able to process it. It is essential that \Sympa scans the digest
queue at least once between the time laid down for sending of the
digest and 12:00~PM. Usually do not use digest time later than
11:00~PM.

            \texttt {mail}

        Mail reception mode.

    \item \lparam {visibility}
            \texttt {conceal} $|$
            \texttt {noconceal} 

        Visibility of the subscriber with the \mailcmd {REVIEW}
        command.

\end {itemize}

Example :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
default_user_options
reception  	digest
visibility	noconceal
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}


\subsection {cookie}

    	\label {par-cookie}
	\index{cookie}

	\default {\cfkeyword {cookie} robot parameter}

\lparam {cookie} \textit {random-numbers-or-letters}

This parameter is a secret item for generating \textindex
{authentication} keys for administrative commands (\mailcmd {ADD},
\mailcmd {DELETE}, etc.).  This parameter should remain secret,
even for owners. The cookie is applied to all list owners, and is
only taken into account when the owner has the \lparam {auth}
parameter (\lparam {owner} parameter, see~\ref {par-owner},
page~\pageref {par-owner}).

\example {cookie secret22}

\subsection {priority}
    \label {par-priority}

	\default {\cfkeyword {default\_list\_priority} robot parameter}

\lparam {priority} \textit {0-9}

This is the priority \Sympa will process messages for this list.
This is applied while going through the spool. 

0 is the highest priority. The following priorities can be used:  
\texttt {0...9~z}.
\texttt {z} is a special priority since messages will
stay in spool forever (useful to hangup a list).

Available since release 2.3.1.

\section {Bounces related}

\subsection {bounce}
    \label {bounce}

This paragraph defines bounce management parameters :

\begin{itemize}

\item
\label {warn-rate}
\lparam {warn\_rate} 

	\default {\cfkeyword {bounce\_warn\_rate} robot parameter}

	Above this rate of bouncing addresses in a list,
	listowner receives a warning for each mail distributed in the list. 

\item
\label {halt-rate}
\lparam {halt\_rate} 

	\default {\cfkeyword {bounce\_halt\_rate} robot parameter}

	\texttt {NOT USED YET}

	If bounce rate reaches the \texttt {halt\_rate}, messages 
	for the list will be halted, ie they are kept for later 
	moderation.Above this rate of bouncing addresses in a list,
	messages for the list aren't distributed. 
	
\end{itemize}

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
## Owners are warned with 10% bouncing addresses
## message distribution is halted with 20% bouncing rate
bounce
warn_rate	10
halt_rate	20
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\subsection {welcome\_return\_path}
\label {welcome-return-path}

	\default {\cfkeyword {welcome\_return\_path} robot parameter}

	If set to \cfkeyword {unique}, the welcome message is sent using
        a unique return path in order to remove the subscriber in case
	of a bounce. 

\subsection {remind\_return\_path} 
\label {remind-return-path}

	\default {\cfkeyword {remind\_return\_path} robot parameter}

	Same as \cfkeyword {welcome\_return\_path} but applyed for remind
        message.


\section {Archives related}

\subsection {archive}
    \label {par-archive}
    \index{archive}

If the \file {config} file contains  a \lparam {archive} paragraph
\Sympa will manage an archive of this list

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
archive
period week
access private
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

If parameter \lparam {archive} is specified, archives are
accessible to users through the \mailcmd {GET} command, 
and the index of the list archives is given by the \mailcmd {INDEX}
command (last message of a list is available using  \mailcmd {LAST} command).


\lparam {period}
    \texttt {day} $|$
    \texttt {week} $|$
    \texttt {month} $|$
    \texttt {quarter} $|$
    \texttt {year}


This parameter specifies how archiving is organised: by \texttt
{day}, by \texttt {week}, by \texttt {month}, by \texttt {quarter}
or by \texttt {year}.  Generation of automatic list archives requires
creation of an archive directory in the root of the list (\tildedir
{sympa/expl/\samplelist/archives/}) where these documents will be
put.

\lparam {access}
    \texttt {private} $|$
    \texttt {public} $|$
    \texttt {owner} $|$
    \texttt {closed} $|$


This parameter specifies who is allowed to send \mailcmd {GET}, \mailcmd {LAST}  or \mailcmd {INDEX}  commands.



\subsection {web\_archive}
    \label {par-web-archive}
    \index{web\_archive}

If the \file {config} file contains  a \lparam {web\_archive} paragraph
\Sympa will copy all messages ditributed in the list to the
"queueoutgoing"  spool. It is intented to be use with WWSympa html
archive tools. This paragraph must contain at least the access
parameter to control who can browse the web archive.

\textit {Example:} 

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
web_archive
access private
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}


Value for web\_archive access parameter must be one of the following :
\lparam {access}
    \texttt {private} $|$
    \texttt {public} $|$
    \texttt {owner} $|$
    \texttt {closed} $|$
    \texttt {listmaster}

\chapter {Shared documents}
    \label {shared}
    \index{shared}

Shared documents are documents that various users can manipulate
on-line via the web interface of \Sympa, whether they're authorized
to. A shared space belongs to a list, and the users of this list 
can upload, download, delete... documents in the shared space.

\WWSympa shared web features are basic. The goal is not to provide
one more sophisticated tool for web publishing, as web dav or such
product like \textit {Rearsite} provide.
Anyhow, it is very useful to be able to define privilege on
web documents in relation with list attributes, like \textit {subscribers},
\textit {list owners}, or \textit {list editors}. 

All files and directories name are converted by Sympa into lower case. The consequence
is that it is impossible to create two deferent document which name differ only
by char case. This has been introduced in Sympa in order to allow correct URL links
even when using some HTML document generator (typically power point) that use 
random case for file name !

In order to have a better control on the documents of
the shared space, each document is linked with specific information : 
its access rights. The safety is thus ensured.

Shared documents of a list are stored in the directory 
\tildedir {sympa/expl/\samplelist/shared}. 

This chapter describe how the shared documents are managed, 
especially considering access rights control. 
In the following, we will see :  

\begin {itemize}
       	\item the kind of operations performed on shared documents 

        \item the access rights management  

        \item the access rights control specification
	
	\item the actions on shared documents behaviour
        
	\item the template files
\end {itemize}

\section {The three kind of operations on a document}
    \label {shared-operations}
Concerning shared documents, we can distinguish three kind of operations which
have the same constraints relating to access control :
\begin{itemize}
	\item The reading operation :\\
	It consists in :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If it's a directory, open it and list its content (only the
		sub-documents the user is authorized to ``see'').
		\item If it's a file, download it, but also display it if it's a
		viewable file (\textit {text/plain}, \textit {text/html} or image). 
	\end{itemize}
	\item The edition operation :\\
	It regroups :
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Subdirectory creation	
		\item File uploading
		\item Description of a document (title and basic information)
		\item Edition on-line of a text file
		\item Document (file or directory) removal. 
		If it's a directory, it must be empty.
		\end{itemize}
	These various actions have the same behaviour concerning access rights. If a user is
	authorized to edit a directory, he can create a subdirectory or upload a file inside,
	describe or delete this directory. If a user is authorized to edit a file, he can edit
	it on-line, describe it, replace or remove it.  
	\item The control operation :\\
	The control operation is directly linked with the access rights notion. If we want the
	shared documents to be safe, we have to control the access on document. Everybody must not
	be authorized to do everything on shared documents. Consequently, each document has
	specific access rights for reading and editing. The control on this document consists
	in changing this Read/Edit rights.\\
	The control operation has more restrictive access rights than the two other operations.
	Only the owner of a document, the privileged owner of the list and the listmaster have
	control rights on a document. So, another action possible on a document if you can
	control it is to set the owner of a document.  
\end{itemize}
	


\section {The description file}
\label {shared-desc-file}
The information (title, owner, access rights...) relative to each document must be stocked. That's 
why each shared document is linked with a special file called a description file.
These files have the prefix \file {.desc}.

The description file of a directory having the path \dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory} has the path
\dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/.desc} .
The description file of a file having the path \dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/myfile.myextension} has the path
\dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/.desc.myfile.myextension} .

\subsection {Structure of description files}

Here is the structure of a decription file of a document : file or directory.
You should \textit {never} have to edit those files.
 
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
title
  <description of the file in several words>

creation
  email        <email of the owner of the document> 
  date_epoch   <date_epoch of the creation of the document>

access
 read <access rights for read>
 edit <access rights for edit>
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

This example is for a document that subscribers can read and only the owner of the document
and the owner of the list can edit.
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
title
  module C++ which uses the class List

creation
  email foo@some.domain.com
  date_epoch 998698638

access
 read  private
 edit  owner
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\section {The predifined scenarii}
    \label {shared-scenarii}

\subsection {The scenario public}
The scenario \textbf {public} is the most permissive scenario. It enables anyone (including
unknown users) to perform the action.

\subsection {The scenario private}
The scenario \textbf {private} is the basic scenario of a shared space. Every subscriber of
the list is authorized to perform the action. The scenario \textbf {private} is the default
read scenario of the \dir {shared} when the shared space is created. 
The default scenario is used only in the list configuration. You can modify it editing
the list configuration file.

\subsection {The scenario owner}
The scenario \textbf {owner} is the more restrictive scenario of a shared space.
Only the listmaster, the owners of the list, and the owner of the document
or those of one of the parent documents are allowed to perform the action.
The default scenario for editing is the scenario \textbf {owner} in the list
configuration. 

\section {The access control}
    \label {shared-access}
The access control is an important operation, which is performed
before every access to a document of the shared space.

The access control on a document of the hierarchy is an iterative
operation on all its parent directories. 
Here are the regulars adopted for the access control.

\subsection {The listmaster and privileged owner case}
Listmaster and privileged list owner are particular users in the shared
web. They are allowed to perform every action on every document of
the shared space. This precaution permits to keep the control on
the shared space. Listmaster and privileged owner can't be excluded
from any document of the shared space.
 
\subsection {The directory \dir {shared} special case}
In order to allow to have a root directory more restrictive than
the subdirectories, the directory \dir {shared} (root directory) has
a special treatment concerning the access control.
The access rights for read and edit are those of the list configuration file.
The control on the root directory is specific. 
The users allowed to change access rights on directory shared are those allowed to edit the
configuration of the list. 
 
\subsection {General case}
Let's take a document with a relative path in the shared space 
\dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/myfile}. This is \textit {not} a document
of the \textit {root} directory. Let's suppose that a user \textbf {X} wants to perform one
of the three operations (read, edit, control) on this document.
The access control will use the following process :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reading operation case\\
	To be authorized to perform the reading action on the document
	\dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/myfile}, the user \textbf {X} must be
	authorized in the description file to read each document of the
	path in their description file.
	Thus, to be allowed to read the file 
	\dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/myfile}, \textbf {X} must be allowed
	to read \dir {myfile} (the scenario of the description file
	of \dir {myfile} must return \textit {do\_it} with the user \textbf {X}), but
	must also be allowed to read \dir {mysubdirectory} 
	and \dir {mydirectory}.\\
	However, the owner of a document or of one of the parent directories
	of the document are allowed to perform \textbf {each action on the document}.
	So, the owners of \dir {myfile}, \dir {mysubdirectory},
	and \dir {mydirectory} are authorized to read
	 \dir {mydirectory/mysubdirectory/myfile}.

	So we can resume this with :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	X can read <a/b/c> 

	if			  

	(X can read <c>
	AND X can read <b>
	AND X can read <a>)
					
	OR

	(X owner of <c>
	OR X owner of <b>
	OR X owner of <a>)
\end{verbatim}			
\end {quote}

	\item Editing operation case\\
	The regulars for edit are exactly the same as read.
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	X can edit <a/b/c> 
	
	if 
		
	(X can edit <c>
	AND X can edit <b>				
	AND X can edit <a>)
					
	OR

	(X owner of <c>
	OR X owner of <b>
	OR X owner of <a>)
\end{verbatim}			
\end {quote}

	\item Control operation case\\
	The access control before performing the control action (change rights
	or set the owner of a document) is much more restrictive.
	Only the owner of a document or the owners of one of the parent
	documents are allowed to control this document.
	Which can be resumed with :
\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	X can control <a/b/c> 

	if
					
	(X owner of <c>
	OR X owner of <b>
	OR X owner of <a>)
\end{verbatim}			
\end {quote}

\end{itemize}

\section {The shared documents actions behaviour}

The shared web feature has called for some new actions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item action D\_ADMIN\\
	Create the shared web, close it or restore it. The d\_admin action is accessible
	from the page \textbf {admin} of the list.
	\item action D\_READ\\
	Reads the document after read access control. If it's a folder, lists all the subdocuments that can
	be read. If it's a file, shows it if it is viewable and download it else.
	If the document to read contains a file named \file {index.html} or \file {index.htm} and if
	the user has no permissions other than read on all the documents inside, the read action will
	consist in displaying the index.
	The d\_read action is accessible from the page \textbf {info} of the list.
	\item action D\_CREATE\_DIR\\
	Creates a new subdirectory in a directory that can be edited. 
	The creator is the owner of the directory. The access rights are
	those of the parent directory.
	\item action D\_DESCRIBE\\
	Describes a document that can be edited.
	\item action D\_DELETE\\
	Deletes a document after edit access control. If it's a folder, it has to be empty.
	\item action D\_UPLOAD\\
	Uploads a file in a directory that can be edited.  
	\item action D\_OVERWRITE\\
	Overwrites a file if it can be edited. The new owner of the file is the one who has done
	the overwriting operation.
	\item actions D\_EDIT\_FILE and D\_SAVE\_FILE\\
	Edits a file and save it after edit access control. The new owner of the file is the one 
	who has done the saving operation. 
	\item action D\_CHANGE\_ACCESS\\
	Changes the access right to a document (read or edit) if can be controled. 
	\item action D\_SET\_OWNER\\
	Changes the owner of a directory if can be controled. The directory must be empty. The new 
	owner can be anyone but he will have to identify to perform any action on the document.

\end{itemize}

\section {The template files}
The following template files have been created for shared web:

\subsection {d\_read.tpl} 
The default page for reading a document. If it's a file, display it if it's
viewable and download it. If it's a directory, shows the listing of all
the subdocuments that can be read, and for each one, proposes the buttons 
to perform actions that are allowed. If the directory can be
edited, proposes the buttons to describe it, upload a file
inside, create a new subdirectory. If it can be edit, propose a button to
edit the access to it. 
\subsection {d\_editfile.tpl} 
The page used to edit a file. If it's a text file, permits to edit it on-line.
The description of the file can be edited in this page. The file can be replaced
by another using this page.

\subsection {d\_control.tpl}
The page to edit the access rights and the owner of a document.

\chapter {Bounces management}

\Sympa allows bounces (non-delivery reports) management. This
prevents list owners from receiving each bounce (1 per message
sent to a bouncing subscriber) in their own mailbox. Without
an automatic processing of bounces, list owners either become
mad or just delete them without further attention.

Bounces are received at \samplelist-owner address, which should
be sent to \file {bouncequeue} program through aliases :

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	\samplelist-owner: "|/home/sympa/bin/bouncequeue \samplelist"
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

\file {bouncequeue} (see \ref{binaries}, page~\pageref{binaries}), stores bounces in a
\tildedir {sympa/spool/bounce/} spool.

Bounces are then processed by \file {bounced.pl} daemon
This daemon analyses bounces to find out what
email addresses are concerned and what kind of error was generated.
If bouncing addresses matche a subscriber's address, information 
are stored in \Sympa database (in subscriber\_table). Moreover, latest
bounce itself is archived in \dir {bounce\_path/\samplelist/email}
(where bounce\_path is defined in a \file {wwsympa.conf} parameter and
email is the user email address).

When reviewing a list, bouncing addresses are tagged as bouncing ;
you may access further information such as : first and last bounces
date, number of received bounces for the address, the last bounce itself.

Further development of \Sympa should allow automatic deletion
of bouncing addresses.

\label {Antivirus}

\Sympa lets you use an external antivirus solution to check the incoming mails.
You must then set the conf-parameters \cfkeyword {antivirus\_path} and 
\cfkeyword {antivirus\_args}
 (see \ref {Antivirus plug-in}, page~\pageref {Antivirus plug-in}.
\Sympa is yet ready to work with Mcafee/uvscan and Fsecure/fsav.
For each mail received, \Sympa splits its parts in the \tildedir {sympa/spool/tmp/antivirus} directory and then calls the antivirus software to check it.
When a virus is detected, \Sympa looks for the virus name in the virus scanner STDOUT, sends a warning \file {your\_infected\_msg.tpl} to the sender of the mail.
The mail is saved as 'bad' and the working directory is deleted (except if \Sympa runs in debug mode).

\chapter {Using \Sympa commands}

Users interact with \Sympa, of course, when they send messages to
one of the lists, but also indirectly through administrative requests
(subscription, list of users, etc.).

This section describes administrative requests, as well as interaction
modes in the case of private and moderated lists.  Administrative
requests are messages whose body contains commands understood by
\Sympa, one per line. These commands can be indiscriminately placed
in the \rfcheader {Subject} or in the body of the message. The
\rfcheader {To} address is generally the \mailaddr {sympa{\at}domain}
alias, although it is also advisable to recognize the \mailaddr
{listserv{\at}domain} address.

Example:

\begin {quote}
\begin{verbatim}
From: pda@prism.uvsq.fr
To: sympa@cru.fr

LISTS
INFO sympa-users
REVIEW sympa-users
QUIT
\end{verbatim}
\end {quote}

Most user commands can have three-letter abbreviations (e.g. \texttt
{REV} instead of \mailcmd {REVIEW}).

\section {User commands}

\begin {itemize}
    \item  \mailcmd {HELP}

        Provides the instructions for use of \Sympa commands.  The
        result is the content of the \file {helpfile.tpl} template
        file. 

    \item  \mailcmd {INFO} \textit {listname}

        Provides the welcome message for the specified list. The
        result is the content of the \tildefile {welcome[.mime]}.

    \item  \mailcmd {LISTS}
        \label {cmd-lists}

        Provides the names of lists managed by \Sympa.  This list
        can either be generated dynamically, using \lparam {visibility}
        (see \ref {par-visibility}, page~\pageref {par-visibility})
        and \texttt {subject} list parameters (\ref {par-subject},
        page~\pageref {par-subject}) but also \tildefile
        {sympa/expl/lists.header} and \tildefile
        {sympa/expl/lists.footer}).  It can also be generated
        statically by including contents of the \tildefile
        {sympa/expl/lists} file, which must be updated manually by
        the robot \textindex {administrator}.

    \item  \mailcmd {REVIEW} \textit {listname}
        \label {cmd-review}

        Provides the parameters of the specified list (owner,
        subscription mode, etc.), as well as the addresses of
        subscribers if the run mode authorizes it. See the \lparam
        {review} parameter (\ref {par-review}, page~\pageref
        {par-review}) for the configuration file of each list,
        which controls consultation authorizations for the subscriber
        list. Since subscriber addresses can be abused by spammers,
        it is strongly advised to \textbf {only authorize owners
        to access the susbcriber list}.

    \item  \mailcmd {WHICH}
         \label {cmd-which}

        Returns the list of lists to which one is subscribed,
        as well as the configuration of his or her subscription to
        each of the lists (DIGEST, NOMAIL, SUMMARY, CONCEAL).

\item  \mailcmd {STATS} \textit {listname}
        \label {cmd-stats}

        Provides statistics for the specified list:
        number of messages received, number of messages sent,
        mega-bytes received, mega-bytes sent. This is the contents
        of the \tildefile {sympa/expl/stats} file

    \item  \mailcmd {INDEX} \textit {listname}
        \label {cmd-index}

        Provides index of archives for specified list. Access rights
        to this function are the same as for the \mailcmd {GET}
        command. 

    \item  \mailcmd {GET} \textit {listname} \textit {archive}
        \label {cmd-get}

        To retrieve archives for list (see above).  Access
        rights are the same as for the \mailcmd {REVIEW} command.
        See \lparam {review} parameter (\ref {par-review},
        page~\pageref {par-review}).

    \item  \mailcmd {LAST} \textit {listname}
        \label {cmd-last}

        To receive the last message distributed in a list (see above).  Access
        rights are the same as for the \mailcmd {GET} command.

    \item  \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE} \textit {listname firstname name}
        \label {cmd-subscribe}

        Requests sign-up to the specified list. The \textit
        {firstname} and \textit {name} are optional. If the
        list is parameterized with a restricted subscription (see
        \lparam {subscribe} parameter, \ref {par-subscribe},
        page~\pageref {par-subscribe}), this command is sent to the
        list owner for approval.

    \item  \mailcmd {INVITE} \textit {listname user@host name}
        \label {cmd-invite}

        Invite someone to subscribe to the specified list. The 
        \textit {name} is optional. The command is similar to the
        \mailcmd {ADD} but the specified person is not added to the
        list but invited to subscribe to it accordind to the 
        \lparam {subscribe} parameter, \ref {par-subscribe},
        page~\pageref {par-subscribe}).


    \item  \mailcmd {SIGNOFF} \textit {listname} [ \textit {user@host} ]
        \label {cmd-signoff}

        Requests unsubscription from the specified list.
        \mailcmd {SIGNOFF *} means unsubscription from all lists.

    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {DIGEST}
        \label {cmd-setdigest}

        Puts the subscriber in \textit {digest} mode for the \textit
        {listname} list.  Instead of receiving mail from the list
        in a normal manner, the subscriber will periodically receive
        it in a DIGEST. This DIGEST compiles a group of messages
        from the list, using multipart/digest mime format.

        The sending period for these DIGESTS is regulated by the
        list owner using the \lparam {digest} parameter (see~\ref
        {par-digest}, page~\pageref {par-digest}).  See the \mailcmd
        {SET~LISTNAME~MAIL} command (\ref {cmd-setmail}, page~\pageref
        {cmd-setmail}) and the \lparam {reception} parameter (\ref
        {par-reception}, page~\pageref {par-reception}).

    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {SUMMARY}
        \label {cmd-setsummary}

        Puts the subscriber in \textit {summary} mode for the \textit
        {listname} list.  Instead of receiving mail from the list
        in a normal manner, the subscriber will periodically receive
        the list of messages. This mode is very close to the DIGEST
        reception mode but the subscriber receive only the list of messages.

        This option is available only if the digest mode is set.

    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {NOMAIL}
        \label {cmd-setnomail}

        Puts subscriber in \textit {nomail} mode for the \textit
        {listname} list.  This mode is used when a subscriber wants
        to no longer receive mail from the list; nevertheless he
        or she maintains the capability of writing in the list.
        This mode therefore prevents the subscriber from unsubscribing
        and subscribing later on.  See the \mailcmd {SET~LISTNAME~MAIL}
        command (\ref {cmd-setmail}, page~\pageref {cmd-setmail}) and
        the \lparam {reception} (\ref {par-reception}, page~\pageref
        {par-reception}). 

    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {MAIL}
        \label {cmd-setmail}

        Puts the subcriber in normal mode (default) for the \textit
        {listname} list.  This option is mainly used to cancel the
        \textit {nomail}, \textit {summary} or \textit {digest} modes. If the subscriber
        was in \textit {nomail} mode, he or she will again receive
        mail from the list in a normal manner.  See the \mailcmd
        {SET~LISTNAME~NOMAIL} command (\ref {cmd-setnomail},
        page~\pageref {cmd-setnomail}) and the \lparam {reception}
        parameter (\ref {par-reception}, page~\pageref {par-reception}).

    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {CONCEAL}
        \label {cmd-setconceal}

        Puts the subscriber in \textit {conceal} mode for the
        \textit {listname} list.  The subscriber will then become
        invisible during \mailcmd {REVIEW} on this list. Only owners
        will see the whole subscriber list.

        See the \mailcmd {SET~LISTNAME~NOCONCEAL} command (\ref
        {cmd-setnoconceal}, page~\pageref {cmd-setnoconceal}) and
        the \lparam {visibility} parameter (\ref {par-visibility},
        page~\pageref {par-visibility}).


    \item  \mailcmd {SET} \textit {listname} \texttt {NOCONCEAL}
        \label {cmd-setnoconceal}

        Puts the subscriber in \textit {noconceal} mode (default)
        for \textit {listname} list. The subscriber will then
        become visible during \mailcmd {REVIEW} of this list. The
        \textit {conceal} mode is then cancelled.

        See \mailcmd {SET~LISTNAME~CONCEAL} command (\ref
        {cmd-setconceal}, page~\pageref {cmd-setconceal}) and
        \lparam {visibility} parameter (\ref {par-visibility},
        page~\pageref {par-visibility}).


    \item  \mailcmd {QUIT}
        \label {cmd-quit}

        Ends acceptance of commands. This can prove useful when
        the message contains additional lines, as for example in
        the case where a signature is automatically added by the
        user's program.

    \item  \mailcmd {CONFIRM} \textit {key}
        \label {cmd-confirm}

        If the \lparam {send} parameter of a list is set to \texttt
        {privatekey, publickey} or \texttt {privateorpublickey},
        messages are only distributed in the list after an
        \textindex {authentication} phase by return mail, using a
        one-time password (numeric key). For this authentication,
        the sender of the message is requested to post the ``\mailcmd
        {CONFIRM}~\textit {key}'' command to \Sympa.

    \item  \mailcmd {QUIET}

        This command is used for silent (mute) processing: no
        performance report is returned for commands prefixed with
        \mailcmd {QUIET}).

\end {itemize}

\section {Owner commands}

Some administrative requests are only available to list owner(s).
They are indispensable for all procedures in limited access mode,
and to perform requests in place of users.
These requests are:

\begin {itemize}
    \item \mailcmd {ADD} \textit {listname user@host firstname name}
        \label {cmd-add}

        Add command similar to \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE}

    \item \mailcmd {DELETE} \textit {listname user@host}
        \label {cmd-delete}

        Delete command similar to \mailcmd {SIGNOFF}

    \item \mailcmd {REMIND} \textit {listname} or \mailcmd {REMIND} \textit {*}
	\label {cmd-remind}

        \mailcmd {REMIND} is used usually by list owner in order to send
        an individual service message to each subscriber. This
        message is make by parsing the remind.tpl file.

        \mailcmd {REMIND} is used to send to each subscriber of any list a single
        message with a summary of his/her subscriptions. In this case the 
        message sent is built by parsing the global\_remind.tpl file.
        Freach list  sympa test if the list is setup as hidden 
	to each subscriber (parameter lparam {visibility}). By default this 
	command usage is limited to listmasters. 
	Processing may take a lot of time !
	
    \item  \mailcmd {EXPIRE}
        \label {cmd-expire}

        % [pda] : huh ???
        % [sa] on touche pas la doc avant d'avoir revu le code
        \textit {listname}
        \textit {age (in days)}
        \textit {deadline (in days)}
        (listname) (age (in days)) (deadline (in days))
        \textit {explanatory text to be sent to concerned subscribers}


        This command activates an \textindex {expiration} process
        for former subscribers of the designated list. Subscribers
        for which no procedures have been enabled for more than
        \textit {age} days receive the explanatory text appended
        to the \mailcmd {EXPIRE} command. This text, which must be
        adapted by the list owner for each subscriber population,
        should explain to the people receiving this message that
        they can update their subscription date so as to not be
        deleted from the subscriber list, within a deadline of
        \textit {deadline} days.

        Past this deadline, the initiator of the \mailcmd {EXPIRE}
        command receives the list of persons who have not confirmed
        their subscription.  It is up to the initiator to send
        \Sympa the corresponding \mailcmd {DELETE} commands.

        Any operation updating the subscription date of an address
        serves as confirmation of subscription. This is also the
        case for \mailcmd {SET} option selecting commands and for
        the \mailcmd {SUBSCRIBE} subscription command itself. The fact
        of sending a message to the list also updates the subscription
        date.

        The explanatory message should contain at least 20 words;
        it is possible to delimit it by the word \mailcmd {QUIT},
        in particular in order not to include a signature, which
        would systematically end the command message.

        A single expiration process can be activated at any given
        time for a given list. The \mailcmd {EXPIRE} command
        systematically gives rise to \textindex {authentication}
        by return mail.  The \mailcmd {EXPIRE} command has \textbf
        {no effect on the subscriber list}.

    \item  \mailcmd {EXPIREINDEX} \textit {listname}
       \label {cmd-expireindex}

       Makes it possible, at any time, for an expiration process
       activated using an \mailcmd {EXPIRE} command to receive the
       list of addresses for which no enabling has been received.

    \item  \mailcmd {EXPIREDEL} \textit {listname}
       \label {cmd-expiredel}

       Deletion of a process activated using the \mailcmd {EXPIRE}
       command.  The \mailcmd {EXPIREDEL} command has no effect on
       subscribers, but it possible to activate a new expiration
       process with new deadlines.

\end {itemize}

As above, these commands can be prefixed with \mailcmd {QUIET} to
indicate processing without acknowledgment of receipt.


\section {Moderator commands}
    \label {moderation}

\Sympa only distributes messages enabled by one of the moderators
(editor) of the list in the moderated list. Moderators have several
methods for enabling message distribution, depending on the \lparam
{send} list parameter (\ref {par-send}, page~\pageref {par-send}).

\begin {itemize}
    \item  \mailcmd {DISTRIBUTE} \textit {listname} \textit {key}
        \label {cmd-distribute}

        If the \lparam {send} parameter of a list is set to \texttt
        {editorkey} or \texttt {editorkeyonly}, each message queued
        for \textindex {moderation} is stored in a spool (see~\ref
        {cf:queuemod}, page~\pageref {cf:queuemod}), and a key is
        associated to it.

        The \textindex {moderator} must use this command to enable
        message distribution.

    \item  \mailcmd {REJECT} \textit {listname} \textit {key}
        \label {cmd-reject}

        The message with the \textit {key} key is deleted from the
        moderation \textindex {spool} of the \textit {listname}
        list.

    \item  \mailcmd {MODINDEX} \textit {listname}
        \label {cmd-modindex}

        This command sends back the list of messages queued for
        moderation for the \textit {listname} list.

        The result is presented in the form of an index, which
        supplies, for each message, its sending date, its sender,
        its size, and the key associated to it, as well as all
        messages in the form of a digest.
