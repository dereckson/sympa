only be one privileged owner per list ; his/her email addresse may not
be edited from the web.

Editors are responsible of messages moderation. If the mailing list is moderated, messages posted to the list will first be passsed to the editors, 
who will decide to distridute or to reject it. <BR>

set the "send" parameter.<BR>
FYI: If the list is moderated, the first editor distributing or rejecting 
a message will make the decision for other editors. If none of them make 
a decision, the message will remain unmoderated in the moderation spool.
